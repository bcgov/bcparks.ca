Many of these became weary of travel and were luredaside to discoveries that were easier to reach. The gold rush cameto Atlin Lake country in 1898 and was one of the richest offshootsof the klondike rush. By the end of the mining season of 1899 about5000 people flocked to the region, and Atlin was a busy and importanttown. Although creeks in the present day park must have been prospected,none bore any gold. Although production was greatest in the earlyyears, the Atlin field still produces today.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Biogeoclimatic Ecosystem Classification zones of the Babine Mountains include sub-boreal spruce and alpine tundra. In the lower altitude forested areas, visitors will find white spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, trembling aspen, black huckleberry, bunchberry and feather mosses. In general, the soils in the Babines are not particularly rich. The climate restricts vegetative growth &ndash; in the lower areas vegetation is much quicker to recover from disturbances and in high elevations the recovery rate is extremely slow. The park contains some of the most norther known examples of whitebark pine. Flowers, trees and shrubs are part of the park&rsquo;s natural heritage; please don&rsquo;t damage or remove them.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The most noteworthy species commonly observed in the area are mountain goats, moose, black bear, ground squirrels, marmots and deer, as well as a host of smaller animals. Of the larger animals, only mountain goats make the area their year-round home. Occasionally grizzly bear, lynx and wolverine have been observed.

These parasites live in tall grass and low shrubs, and seek out warm-blooded hosts. As potential carriers of disease, they should be avoided. Protect your legs by wearing gaiters, or pants tucked into socks. After any outdoor activities, thoroughly examine yourself, children and pets. If you find a tick embedded in your skin, the best way to remove it is by grasping and pulling it, gently, straight up and out with a small pair of tweezers, and disinfecting the site with rubbing alcohol. You may wish to save the tick in a small plastic or glass container for later inspection by your doctor especially if a fever develops, or the area around the bite appears to be infected. </p> </li> <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Babine Mountains Provincial Park lies within the traditional territories of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en and Ned&rsquo;u&rsquo;ten peoples, with the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en occupying the Wetzin&rsquo;Kwa (Bulkley/Morice River) valley and the Ned&rsquo;u&rsquo;ten occupying the Babine Lake area. Both nations have used, and continue to use, the area for spiritual and sustenance activities, including hunting, trapping and fishing. Many of the existing trails within Babine Mountains Provincial Park were originally trails used by the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en and Ned&rsquo;u&rsquo;ten.</li> </ul>",

Acting as an ice dam, the glacier prevented the lake from draining down the Bear River Valley. If enough water collects behind an ice dam, a glacier may begin to float. Water flowing under the ice quickly creates a large tunnel. The lake empties, the ice dam resettles, and water again begins to collect until another flood is triggered. Five times between 1958 and 1962 Strohn Lake emptied underneath its ice dam in a catastrophic tumult of muddy water, rock and ice. This type of flood is known by the Icelandic term &ldquo;jokulhlaup.&rdquo; In 1967, Bear Glacier melted away from the valley wall and Strohn Lake was no longer dammed. The threat of sudden destructive icy floods in the Bear River Valley disappeared with the glacier&rsquo;s retreat. Bear Glacier Park was designated as a Class A Provincial Park in 1998.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Bear Glacier Park lies within the Nass Wildlife area and protects part of a large glacier and a glacial lake. </li>    </ul>",

			"description": "<!--#include virtual=\"/_shared/includes/imageGallery.shtm\"--><p>Big Bar Lake Provincial Park comprises approximately 330 hectares of rolling landscape situated on the shore of a large lake, and scattered with small lakes and ponds. The park is couched in typical Cariboo ranching country on the southern edge of the Fraser Plateau. This extensive plateau stretches north beyond Lac La Hache, and was formed from lava flows some five to ten million years ago. The park was established in 1969, and is a very popular destination for family camping vacations. The park features 25 new lakeside campsites in addition to a large day-use area offering beachside picnic areas and a Big Toy for children. The construction project was funded by FRBC through the Campgrounds BC Initiative, and was completed in the summer of 1999. </p><p> The park&rsquo;s setting is typical of the southern Cariboo. Set against a mountainousbackdrop, the lake is surrounded by lodgepole pine and spruce. Visitors ofBig Bar Lake Park often see wildlife on the 4 km hiking trail surrounding thescenic wetlands, and enjoy angling for rainbow trout in the 3-mile long lake.The area is an extremely popular fishing destination, and is also widely usedby other recreationists. Area attractions include several guest ranches, thetowering Marble Range south of the park, and Gang Ranch country. Visitors canalso travel along the Jesmond Loop, by continuing past Big Bar Lake ProvincialPark, and eventually connecting with Highway 97 by way of the Jesmond and KellyLake Roads. This scenic drive passes by Little Big Bar Lake and the historictownsite of Jesmond, where the OK Corral - one of the oldest ranches in thearea - is situated. The loop also accesses the Jesmond fire lookout by wayof a narrow four-wheel drive road, from which visitors can enjoy panoramicviews of the surrounding landscape, including Marble Range and Edge Hills ProvincialParks. Big Bar Lake Park and the surrounding country provide a beautiful settingfor a summer holiday.</p><p> Big Bar Lake Park is easily accessible, and provides a range of recreationalopportunities for outdoor enthusiasts. Some of the major recreational opportunitiesavailable in the park include day-use picnicking, lakeside camping, boating,canoeing and kayaking, swimming, wildlife viewing, hiking, and fishing.Abundant rainbow trout typically reward the angler; fishing is active nearlyall season, but is typically the best between mid May and late July.

			"locationNotes": "<ul> <li> <a href=\"/explore/map.html\">Location Map</a> </li> </ul> Bugaboo Provincial  Park is located in southeastern B.C., between Golden and Radium Hot Springs, and west of Highway 95. Access to the park is about 50km of gravel road from Hwy #95. This gravel road, which opens late spring through late fall, begins at Brisco, 27 kilometres north of Radium Hot Springs or 76 km south of Golden on Highway 95. A 4x4 is not required but a 2wd with some decent ground clearance is recommended. The last 3km section of the gravel road is rough; low-riding compact vehicles need to go slow to avoid scraping the bottom. It is recommended that visitors protect their vehicle perimeter with a portable chicken wire fence to deter porcupines and other small animals from chewing on rubber brake lines and tires. <br> <br> Access to the northern portions of the park via the Vowell and Malloy Creek drainages is possible by leaving Highway 95 at Spillimacheen, north of Brisco, then crossing the Columbia River and turning left on the West Side Road. After travelling 0.8 km, turn right onto Bobbie Burns Creek drainage and drive past the lodge of the same name. Logging roads up Vowell Creek and Malloy Creek lead to semi-open terrain which can be hiked into the park. The status of bridges in inactive logging areas may vary in upper drainages. <br> <br> <h4>Winter Access </h4> <p> Access roads are not maintained in winter. Snowmobiles are not permitted in the park and must be left at the summer parking lot. </p> <p> Visitors wishing to visit the park in the winter months will either need to ski the long access road or use snowmobile, as far as the summer parking lot, or helicopter access. Independent parties (non-helicopter skiing clients) require a <a href=\"https://forms.gov.bc.ca/environment/bugaboo-helicopter-landing-lop/\">letter of permission</a> (LOP) to fly into the park by helicopter. Information on winter access to the park may be obtained from the Ministry of Environment office at 250 489-8540. </p>",

Historic trails provided access through this area and a traditional cabin still exists at Shea Lake. The Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en continue to use this area.</p><p>The Howson Range has a history of mountaineering dating back to the 1950&rsquo;s, when Rex Gibson, then president of the Alpine Club of Canada, led 3 successive trips to the area. On his fourth trip in 1957, Gibson was attempting to climb Howson Peak with Sterling Hendricks and Don Hubbard. A fall while the party was roped together pulled all three members down the side of the mountain. Gibson died of his injuries before help could arrive.</p><p>The wetlands, meadows, and rich avalanche tracks, combined with the absence of substantive human presence, provide good quality grizzly bear habitat. The alpine and subalpine areas on the east side of the park and beyond provide habitat for the recovering population of northern caribou known as the Telkwa herd, while the terrain around the Howson Range is home to a healthy population of mountain goats. Other species known to use the area include black bear, moose, wolverine, and deer. Burnie Lakes support a diverse fish population including kokanee and mountain whitefish.</p><p>The park also protects whitebark pine communities. Whitebark pine communities are regionally significant because they are at the most northerly extent of their range. Whitebark pine are declining throughout their range due to mountain pine beetle and white pineblister rust. Clark&rsquo;s Nutcrackers are dependent on whitebark pine seeds for survival. Theseeds are also important to other wildlife species, especially grizzly bear.</p>",

Working for the Canadian Government, he made a scouting trip west to the Rockies. The report he submitted back to the Government, contributed to the establishment of the Northwest Mounted Police in the area. He returned to the area again in 1873. His journey west took him by dogsled to what we now know as Fort St. John. He continued on to Hudson&rsquo;s Hope by horseback and from there paddled the Peace River by canoe. Since that time the area has received many names such as the Butler Range, Butler Mountain, and eventually to what we know it as today, Butler Ridge. The park was established in 2000. </li> <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> First Nations of the Treaty 8 Tribal Association have traditionally used he area.</li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Butler Ridge Provincial Park is located in the Peace Foothill ecosection just east of the Rocky Mountains.    The area provides important winter range for caribou and stone sheep habitat in the higher elevations as well as moose and elk winter range in the lower elevations. A blue-listed species, the Arkansas rose, has been recorded in the park.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife (specific to this park or area):</strong> This area provides excellent fishing and wildlife viewing opportunities. If you look closely, you may be able to spot stone sheep resting in the canyon, just to the right of the boat launch. Deer, elk, golden eagles and other wildlife are common to the area as well as numerous waterfowl and shorebirds. <ul> <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>",

Rocky promontories, salt marshes and jagged headlands punctuate the fine-textured, white-sand beaches. The most impressive of these beaches, Nels Bight, stretches more than 2,400 metres long and 210 metres wide at low tide, and is one of the park&rsquo;s most popular camping destinations. Other significant beaches include San Josef Bay, Guise Bay, Experiment Bight, Lowrie Bay and Nissen Bight. </p> <p> Visitors can choose between a day hike or a backpacking excursion to explore the sandy beaches, rainforests, and lowland bogs and muskeg of this wilderness park. </p> <ul> <li> <a href=\"hiking.html\">Hiking trails in Cape Scott Provincial Park</a> </li> </ul> <p> <strong>Special Features:</strong> </p> <p> Cape Scott Provincial Park is home to sea stacks, which visitors can access at low tide.

Examples of these trees can be found throughout the park, including on the easy hike to San Josef Beach. About 20 minutes north of the Eric Lake campsite is a Sitka Spruce that measures more than 7 metres in circumference.

The park is situated in the interior wet belt between Bowron Lake and Wells Gray Provincial Parks. These parks now create one continuous protected area in the Cariboo Mountains that is over 760,000 hectares in size.     </p>     <p>      The park incorporates a diverse landscape ranging from mountain peaks      and tarn lakes in hanging alpine valleys, to extensive meadows, large      wetland complexes, and ancient red-cedar and hemlock forests. These diverse      habitats support an equally diverse array of wildlife species. Though      current use levels are low, Cariboo Mountains Provincial Park offers extensive, though undeveloped, opportunities for backcountry adventures.     </p>     <p>Vehicle access camping is available at the <a href=\"http://www.sitesandtrailsbc.ca/search/search-result.aspx?site=REC2747&type=Site\">Ghost Lake Recreation Site</a>.

The lower Carmanah Valley was declared a provincial park in 1990, and the Walbran and upper Carmanah Valleys were added in 1995. The park offers protection to diverse forest ecosystems, including a large Sitka spruce ecosystem that represents 2% of BC&rsquo;s remaining old-growth forest.</p><p>Carmanah Walbran is home to some of the world&rsquo;s largest spruce trees, some reaching heights in excess of 95 metres and living for 800 years or more. The park is also home to ancient, gnarled cedars &ndash; estimated to be well over 1,000 years old &ndash; clinging to the side hills. Nestled beneath these awe-inspiring trees is a diverse variety of flora and fauna possible only in an ecosystem that has remained undisturbed for hundreds of years.</p><p>The recent addition of the Walbran and upper Carmanah Valleys completes the protection of the Carmanah Creek watershed and the southern portion of the Walbran Creek watershed. The park provides unique opportunities for forest research and education in the areas of biodiversity, wildlife and fisheries habitat. It is a majestic forest capable of inspiring all visitors who come here, and offers unforgettable recreational opportunities for hikers and wilderness lovers.</p><p>This coastal fringe of mainly Sitka spruce, with its associated plants and animals, is truly a special place to discover. Sitka spruce forests are typically coast-hugging &ndash; they are rarely found more than 80 kilometres inland and at elevations greater than 30 metres. The park&rsquo;s extensive groves of spruce attain a biomass (weight of plants per hectare) that is nearly twice that of a tropical forest. This dynamic system has developed over thousands of years and functions perfectly if left undisturbed.</p><p>Several hiking trails in the Carmanah Valley provide access to manyof the park&rsquo;s notable natural features, including some of the area&rsquo;s largest trees. Many sections of the trail are extremely muddy and difficult. Be equipped with appropriate clothing (including adequate rain gear) and good hiking boots.</p><p><strong>Date Established:</strong> March 13, 1991 <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 16,365 hectares<br></p>",

It contains habitat for 14 red/blue-listed plant species, 3 red/blue-listed mammals and 2 red-listed bird species (Sandhill crane and Prairie falcon). Forest cover is also varied. Douglas-fir predominates in the lower levels, interspersed with stands of cottonwood and aspen along the waterways. Lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce prefer higher ground, giving way to sub-alpine fir, balsam fir and Lyall&rsquo;s larch. Flowers abound here, with heather and lupine and other varieties being fairly common at higher levels.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The list of wildlife in the park is lengthy. Hikers may see larger mammals such as mule deer, mountain goat and California bighorn sheep and the park encompasses grizzly and black bear habitat, though sightings are rare. The red-listed badger is also found in the park. Even casual visitors are apt to hear the whistle of a marmot as it suns itself on rocky outcroppings, or be accompanied by the chatter of squirrels and the raucous call of the whiskey jacks that frolic and flit along the forested trails. Most of the lakes and waterways support populations of rainbow and cutthroat trout.<ul><li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li></ul></li></ul>",

One of these men, Henry Cody, discovered the Cody Caves. Later, in 1899, the caves were the subject of a short story written by Roger Pocock for &ldquo;Argosy&rdquo; magazine entitled &ldquo;The Noble Five&rdquo;. This story described a cave whose inner chambers were walled with gold ore. The caves then grew in popularity and were visited by many locals and curious individuals including, in 1908, the governor General of Canada, Earl Grey. Though they are not walled with gold, the caves do contain an impressive display of calcite formations that can be seen in many areas of the approximately 800 metres of explorable passage. These formations are extremely old and have been growing at an average rate of about one cubic centimetre a century. The cave itself began formation when limestone beds laid down almost 600 million years ago were thrust upward by mountain building forces that occurred around 170 million years ago. Although the Cody Caves are almost unimaginably old and carved from solid rock, they are exceptionally fragile and can be irreparably damaged in seconds. In fact the caves have probably experienced more change in the 90 years since their discovery than in the previous 9,000.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Only guided cave tours for visitors&rsquo; safety and for protection of the cave&rsquo;s features.</li>      <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>     </ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li> <strong>History:</strong> The lake is fed by East Creek and is drained by Conkle Creek to the north, which eventually joins    the West Kettle River near Westbridge. Conkle Lake, Creek and nearby Mountain are named for W.H. Conkle, who settled in the kettle Valley in the 1890&rsquo;s. Two rustic log cabins near the park entrance were once part of a fishing resort that catered to anglers who came to the lake to fish for rainbow trout. The resort no longer operates, but the fish are still in Conkle Lake. </li> <li> <strong>Conservation:</strong> The park is representative of the Okanagan Highlands landscape with good deer, elk and moose range.    The Okanagan Highlands landscape has very few protected areas which increases the importance of Conkle Lake on a provincial scale. The dominant plant community in the park is a mixed forest of lodgepole pine and immature Western larch. Logging and a fire in the 1930&rsquo;s left few of the original mature larch standing. Black alder and willow are profuse along the lakeshore and in the East Creek delta. Common shrubs and flowering plants include false box, Oregon grape, broadleaf arnica, lupine and red paintbrush. </li> <li> <strong>Wildlife:</strong> Bird species often seen include the common loon, common merganser, ruffed grouse, pileated woodpecker, black-capped chickadee, and ruby-crowned kinglet.

As the population of the area increased there was an increasing necessity for more areas for skiing and hiking which resulted in the creation of Cypress Provincial Park.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park has many natural highlights, including several sparkling mountain lakes--such as Blue Gentian, First, Yew, Cabin and West &mdash; that are nestled below the peaks of Mount Strachan (1,454 m), Black Mountain (1,217 m) and Hollyburn Mountain (1,325 m).</p><p>Where the access road enters the park, at an elevation of 300 m, you pass first through a coastal Douglas-fir forest; this is a fire-scarred area with even-age stands of mixed Douglas-fir and western hemlock. Logging activities prior to the establishment of the park have opened much of the forest floor to the luxuriant growth of vine maple and cedar. Between 800 m and 940 m elevation, the forest gradually changes and, as the ridge tops are approached at 1,300 m above sea level, mountain hemlock, amabalis fir and yellow cypress, for which the park is named, predominate. The lush understory consists largely of shade-tolerant ferns, huckleberries, red and white heather, and false azaleas.</p><p>Invasive plants occur in the park and are being managed by BC Parks and partners.

Coyotes and deer are often seen close to the access road. Black bears, squirrels, hares and weasels may be encountered in the backcountry.

Views of mountains, and 2,245 metre Mount Bowman, a spectacular mountain ridge visible from the nearby Jesmond Road, give the park a remote atmosphere, though it is located close to Clinton.     </p>     <p>      This 14-site vehicle-accessible campground was re-built in 2015 and re-opened to the public in May of 2016. Swimming in Kelly  Lake is enjoyable from the long sandy beach. Angling for rainbow trout is a popular past time. Many visitors use the park as a stopping place as they travel the Pavilion Mountain Road, which connects the Cariboo to Lillooet. This scenic alternative to Highway 99 is unpaved, narrow and switch-backed and best suited for compact 4x4 vehicles.     </p>     <p>The park land was donated to the people of BC by C. S. Downing in 1970, and his family still owns adjacent property. Please respect this private property by keeping to the road when walking between the day-use area and campground.     </p>     <p>Nearby parks also offering campgrounds include <a href=\"../green_lk/\">Green Lake</a> and <a href=\"../big_bar_lk/\">Big Bar Lake</a>. Visitors can also travel along the Jesmond Loop, by travelling north-west from the park to Jesmond Road. This scenic drive passes by the historic townsite of Jesmond, where the OK Corral &ndash; one of the oldest ranches in the area &ndash; is situated, and continues past Little Big Bar Lake. The loop also accesses the Jesmond fire lookout by way of a narrow four-wheel drive road, from which adventurous visitors can enjoy panoramic views of the surrounding landscape, including <a href=\"../marble_range/\">Marble Range</a> and <a href=\"../edge_hills/\">Edge Hills</a> Provincial Parks. This route eventually connects with Highway 97 and provides a scenic trip for travellers heading to Green Lake or beyond.     </p>     <p>      <strong>Established Date:</strong> July 9, 1970<br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 139 hectares<br>     </p>",

And you don&rsquo;t have to go far to find fish &ndash; from November to March, the steelhead run right by the campsites on the Quinsam River. As spring progresses, lakes in the area &ndash; many of which have been stocked &ndash; ripple with rainbow, cutthroat and dolly varden trout. During late spring and through the summer, fishermen head to the tidal waters to fish for chinook or coho salmon.</p><p>After a morning of fishing, pack a picnic lunch and take a cool stroll to the Elk Falls day-use area. Just 3 km from the campground, this picnic area contains easy walking trails and the plunging 25-metre waterfall that gives this park its name. Hiking trails also lead to other areas in the park, which is home to the only significant stand of old-growth Douglas fir north of MacMillan Provincial Park.</p><p>The large campground at Elk Falls Provincial Park provides a convenient base camp for day tripping.

The area came into the hands of a man named Walker, who felt Emory Creek would become the head of riverboat navigation on the Fraser. Eventually, he sold the land to the Oppenheimer Brothers in early 1879. In the fall of 1879, Emory was chosen by the C.P.R. as the western terminus. In a short time it became Emory Creek. The town consisted of thirteen streets with its own newspaper, various shops, a brewery, nine saloons and a sawmill. When Yale was made the terminus, Emory was all but abandoned by 1885, with the completion of the railway.

From the delta area to a forested area made up of ridges and deep slopes, this park offers two dramatically different topographical areas. There is over 2 km of waterfront with surrounding mountains and deep canyons. Shorts Creek passes through a deep canyon creating a series of waterfalls and deep pools. With almost two kilometres of waterfront property, the park has opportunities for camping, swimming, fishing, canoeing, kayaking, hiking and wildlife viewing. Recreational users can enjoy the natural sand beach while wildlife viewers can hike the Canyon trail and view a variety of birds, small mammals, deer and bighorn sheep in the higher regions.</p><p>Historical features throughout the park include the Manor House, the octagonal barn and several other farm buildings. A small wetland area located south of the Packing House, a portion of lakeshore and the Shorts Creek corridor and canyon below Westside Road are designated Special Feature-Natural Conservation Areas. Notable features within the zone include a large eagle&rsquo;s nest, old growth cottonwoods and several wildlife trees, Shorts Creek waterfall and kokanee spawning grounds. The Fintry Manor House, garden, the barns, remnant power generation and irrigation systems are special heritage features.</p><p>Fintry Protected Area was established on April 18, 2001, to enhance the ecological viability of the existing park.

It includes a highly   productive and unique tidal narrows at its entranceway. Because of the heavy tide influence in the narrows the oceanic productivity in this area is very high compared to the rest of the Douglas Channel. The kelp beds that are found in this area support nurseries for a wide array of sea life.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Foch-Gilttoyees protects a regionally significant estuary complex at the north end of the Gilttoyees    Inlet. The Gilttoyees Creek and Peechugh Creek estuary is notable for its well-developed inter-tidal flats and relatively under-developed mud flats.    Salt-water marsh and meadow communities dominate the inter-tidal flats. The estuary has very high wildlife values, particularly over-wintering habitat for the Blue-listed Trumpeter Swan, Barrow&rsquo;s Goldeneye, Harlequin Duck, Surf Scoter, Long-tailed duck and Western Grebe.</li> </ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li> <strong>History:</strong> In 1860, while carrying out a survey of Howe Sound on board the Royal Navy survey ship H.M.S. Plumper, Captain George Henry was impressed by a towering mountain dominating the view to the northeast. Captain Richards chose to name the 2,678 metre mountain Mount Garibaldi, after the great 19th century Italian patriot and soldier, Giuseppe Garibaldi, a guerrilla general whose exploits and valour were held in high esteem. In 1907, a party of six Vancouver climbers reached the summit of Mount Garibaldi. The views from the peak inspired the establishment of summer climbing camps at Garibaldi Lake. This early interest led to the creation in 1920 of a park reserve. Garibaldi Provincial Park was legislated as a Class A park in 1927, a 195,000 hectare mountain wilderness just 64 kilometres north of Vancouver. </li> <li> <strong>Conservation:</strong> During July and August the alpine areas of Garibaldi Provincial Park offer hikers an opportunity to view alpine flowers in bloom, a beautiful display of nature. Please keep to designated trails. Shortcutting trails destroys plant life and soil structure in fragile alpine meadows. Trail erosion by rain and melting snow occurs rapidly as a result. BC Parks asks for your cooperation as we help to repair damaged areas. Please help by obeying posted signs. </li> <li> <strong>Wildlife:</strong> Small mammals and birds such as squirrels, chipmunks, grey jays, and flickers can often be seen. Large mammals such as mountain goats, deer, cougars, wolverines, grizzly and black bears, also call the park home, although are seen less frequently. </li> </ul>",

In 1863, a guide from the Lheidli T&rsquo;enneh lead two Black miners across the trail, John Robert Giscome of Jamaica and Henry McDame from the Bahamas. These two men originally came to North America for the California Gold Rush, but arriving near the end of the rush they headed to the gold fields of the North. The trail now bears the name of Giscome as one of the first non-natives to travel across the portage. After being petitioned, the government constructed a wagon road over the Giscome Portage, and the navigation on the Crooked River was improved in 1871. Despite the numerous travellers using the Giscome Portage, no actual community developed there until the early years of the 20th century. This community was later to be known as the Huble Homestead. World War I initiated the decline of Giscome Portage and the decline accelerated with the construction of a road between Prince George and Summit Lake in 1919. Giscome Portage was bypassed as the transportation method shifted from water to road.      </li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Park Visitors are able to view many species of native wildlife within a natural setting.

There&rsquo;s something new, different and exciting every month of the year at Goldstream Park.     </p>     <p>     Goldstream&rsquo;s numerous trails criss-cross through the dramatically different terrain of two distinct vegetation zones. The park is home to 600-year-old Douglas fir trees and western red cedar, mixed with western yew and hemlock, red alder, big leaf maple and black cottonwood. On the drier ridges visitors can find flowering dogwood, lodgepole pine and arbutus. The arbutus, with its thick leathery evergreen leaves, red-dish trunk and peeling bark, is Canada&rsquo;s only broad-leafed evergreen and is found exclusively on Vancouver Island and on the southwest coast of British Columbia. In the spring and early summer, Goldstream overflows with colourful wildflowers, including the shade-loving western trillium and the calypso, a delicate orchid of the mossy forest glades.     </p>     <p>     Trails range from easy, wheelchair accessible walks to strenuous hikes and track along creeks, through forested uplands and past abandoned gold diggings from the days of the Gold Rush. More adventurous hikers can climb to the top of one of the highest points in Greater Victoria &ndash; Mt Finlayson, a recent addition to the park in 1994. Another trail leads you to stunning Niagara Falls, which cascades 47.5 metres down a rock cliff into a crystal clear canyon pool below.     </p>     <p>     The park is also the site of an annual chum salmon spawning run, which draws thousands of salmon &ndash; and visitors &ndash; every year. Riverside trails and observation platforms provide extraordinary opportunities to view this natural phenomenon, which also attracts Bald eagles, who swoop down to devour the bodies of the spawned out salmon.     </p>     <p>     Park naturalists are available at the Freeman King Visitor Center, which offers interpretive programs and informative lectures about the area&rsquo;s natural history for individuals and groups. The park also features a large picnic area with shelters, as well as vehicle accessible camping and group sites.     </p>     <p>     For your convenience during the summer season, this park has a small concession managed by the Park Operator.     </p>     <p>     <strong>Established Date:</strong> June 26, 1958<br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 477 hectares (454 ha upland, 23 ha foreshore)     </p>     <p><strong>Special Features:</strong>     </p>     <ul>    <li>Goldstream Park is home to waterfalls, including <strong>Niagara Falls</strong>, which at 47.5 metres is almost at high as its famous namesake, and <strong>Goldstream Falls</strong>, a small waterfall located in the southwest corner of the park near the campground.</li>     <li>Goldstream is also part of the Nanaimo Lowlands Ecosection and the Coastal Douglas Fir Biogeoclimatic Zone.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li><strong>History:</strong> The area is rich in the logging history of the Cowichan Valley, and a number of displays and demonstration forests are located near the park. The forest was one of the first on the island to be logged, probably because of the relative ease with which the felled trees could be skidded to the lake and floated to the mills. The notched stumps supported springboards that allowed old-time loggers to stand above the dense shrubbery so they could cut down the massive trees that dominated the area.</li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The forest floor is covered with the same kind of shrubs that made such hard work for the fallers: thimbleberry, salal and salmonberry. You can also see vanilla leaf, foamflower and bunchberry which grow closer to the ground. Dolly Varden, Rainbow and Cutthroat trout live in the lake and chum, coho and Chinook salmon spawn in the lake and its tributaries. Steelhead spawn in the Cowichan River. Rare rocky mountain juniper adds to the uniqueness of the area. Adjacent to Gordon Bay Provincial Park is Honeymoon Bay Ecological Reserve, which protects a variety of rare and endangered plant species.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> As you walk through the forest, look for deer, raccoons and red squirrels. Birdwatchers often see juncos, Stellar&rsquo;s jays and chestnut-backed chickadees, as well as mergansers and golden eye ducks. Black bears, Roosevelt elk, black-tail deer, beaver, raccoons and cougars can all be spotted in the park.</li> </ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> Hai Lake &ndash; Mount Herman Park was designated as a park on May 20, 2004 following recommendations from the Kalum Land and Resource Management Plan.<p>Mount Herman and Herman Lake were named after Peter Herman of Port Essington, who was born in Germany in 1862 and immigrated to Canada in 1882. He worked at the Port Essington cannery where he met and married Kate Spence (a native woman from Victoria, BC) and had four children (Willie, Walter, Rhoderic and Hilda). They later moved to Lakelse Lake near Terrace, where Peter logged and trapped. Peter became president of the Liberal Association of the north and a Liberal candidate for Skeena in 1903, but lost. Peter died in a drowning accident in 1907. His body was never found.</p></li>       <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Hai Lake &ndash; Mount Herman Park lies within the traditional territory of the Kitselas First Nation. This park and the surrounding area are important to First Nations peoples for sustenance and cultural activities. In recent times the area has been a popular skating, fishing and camping location for Terrace residents and Boy Scouts.</li>       <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Herman Lake wetland is a Class 1 (&gt; 5 ha) riparian wetland that contains regionally significant salmon spawning and rearing habitat and Herman Creek is a salmonid spawning stream. The bog ecosystem around Herman Lake contains scattered and stunted Lodgepole Pine, Western Red Cedar, and Western Hemlock. In addition to water loving shrubs and herbs, the bogs contain specialized plants such as Sundew, White Bog Orchids and Bog Club Moss. Accumulations of moss and organic material are often greater than 100 cm and water tables are within 20 cm of the surface. The bog system is very susceptible to disturbance. Organic soils and dwarf shrubs can be severely damaged by vehicles and trampling. Re-growth after damage is slow. Regionally significant old growth Western Hemlock forest is located in the park (approximately 95 ha). This is one of the very few remaining old growth stands in the main Kitimat &ndash; Kitsumkalum valley.</li>     <li><a href=\"/visiting/wildlife-safety/\">Wildlife Safety</a></li>    </ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>      <li><strong>History:</strong> H&aacute;thayim was named Von Donop Inlet by Captain Daniel Pender of the Royal Navy, who conducted extensive hydrographic surveys in the area from 1860 until 1879. The name commemorates Victor Edward John Breton Von Donop, RN. Von Donop, a midshipman, arrived aboard HMS Charybis at Esquimalt in 1862. Charybis, a ship of 21 guns, had been dispatched to Canada from China at the time of the American Civil War when it seemed possible that hostilities might break out between Great Britain and the United States. Since it was first surveyed, this quiet inlet has contributed to the economy of British Columbia. Evidence of past logging and settlement is inconspicuous, as much of the area is being reclaimed by nature. </li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Lush forests of Douglas-fir, western hemlock, and western red cedar with scattered patches of Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine, big-leaf maple and red alder that characterize the southern British Columbia coast are well represented around Von Donop Inlet. The old-growth forest between the inlet and Robertson/Wiley Lakes and the mature second-growth forest along the outlet of Robertson Lake are part of the area&rsquo;s mosaic. Undergrowth, in the form of red huckleberry, salal, Oregon grape and other shrubs and shade-tolerant ferns and flowering plants contributes to this forest&rsquo;s natural diversity. </li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The park is home to Flying squirrels and Douglas squirrels, as well as river otter and mink. Harbour seals are often seen in the inlet, and during the winter months, Steller&rsquo;s and California sea  lions are present. Killer whales occasionally pass through Sutil Channel, but rarely enter the inlet. H&aacute;thayim contains excellent shellfish, including butter clams and littleneck clams. Paralytic Shellfish Poisoning (PSP) may be present from May through August. Please check with the Department of Fisheries inCampbell River for recent information on harvesting and PSP regulations. Other forms of sea life present include jellyfish, sea sponges, cucumbers, octopus and turnicates. Nearby waters are noted for salmon and rockfish. Seabird populations increase during the winter months in the park. During spring and summer, visitors can hear the calls of varied thrush and Swainson&rsquo;s thrush, a variety of flycatchers as well as yellow-rumped townsend&rsquo;s and black-throated grey warblers. Bald eagles are often seen soaring above the inlet.</li>      </ul>",

Please stay on designated trails to protect these fragile areas.</p> <p>A recent addition to Helliwell Park is Flora Islet, which sits off the end of St. John&rsquo;s Point. Flora Islet was designated as part of the park through the Pacific Marine Heritage Legacy and is one of only two locations in the world where divers can see the rare Six-gill shark.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> In 1915, the pioneer settler known as Cougar Annie arrived on the west coast in Hesquiat Harbour and homesteaded on this wilderness property. She bore 8 of her 11 children here, outlasted 4 husbands and carved a magnificent, magical garden out of a thick and foreboding rainforest. The remoteness of the area brought inherent risks to Annie and her family; cougars prowled endlessly nearby, sensing easy prey. Ada Annie Rae-Arthur shot and trapped dozens of the animals and thus emerged the legend of Cougar Annie. This garden is now one of British Columbia&rsquo;s premier heritage gardens. Surrounded by the tall trees of the West Coast rainforest, Cougar Annie&rsquo;s garden is a place of strange and compelling beauty. From this remote location, Annie ran a nursery garden and shipped countless varieties of plants across Canada. For decades she advertised her wares (and occasionally for husbands) in the Western Producer and in the Winnipeg Free Press. The garden consists of a five-acre clearing, criss-crossed with more than two kilometres of meandering pathways and dotted with outbuildings that once housed goats and chickens. Resurrected from a tangle of salal, Scotch broom, and salmonberry, this garden has endured for nearly 100 years. The survival and the continuity of the garden make it an important heritage site. No other pioneer homestead in Clayoquot Sound remains in private hands and no other garden of this scope exists on the West Coast.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> There are many First Nations cultural heritage sites in Hesquiat Peninsula Park, including middens.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> This prominent low-elevation peninsula is a significant wilderness area protecting heritage sites,  representative old-growth forest stands of Sitka spruce, lodgepole pine, white pine and yellow-cedar and a freshwater lake. The park also encompasses a variety of coastal ecosystems including extensive off-shore reefs, boulder, cobble and sand beaches, sea caves, sheltered bays, kelp beds and mudflats.</li></ul>",

For those that prefer their adventures above-ground, the park also offers a Cave &amp; Karst Education Centre that features geology information, a small museum and fossil display in addition to Canada’s only Cave Theatre, so visitors can learn more about this unique environment without having to venture underground. Other above-ground opportunities include a self-guided walk through the amazing surface geology on the &ldquo;Phil Whitfield Interpretive Trail&rdquo; that highlights interesting surface features detailed in a self-guiding brochure. </p> <p> Spelunking is the art of cave exploration and Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park is the perfect place to discover this unique activity. From educational family-oriented tours to deep, dark adventure, the caves protected within this park offer something for everyone. Knowledgeable guides can lead visitors  through the caves to discover this magical world of crystal formations and ancient fossils firsthand. Though the park has two small caves visitors can explore on their own, a guided tour of one of the larger caves offers more variety and a chance to learn about the cave&rsquo;s unique geology and history. </p> <p> Whichever method of exploring the caves you choose, you are bound to be fascinated by this amazing underground world in the heart of Vancouver Island. <br> <strong>Park Size:</strong> 158 hectares <br> <strong>Date Established:</strong> January 26, 1971 </p>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li> <strong>History</strong> - The first written records of caves in the area came after the turn of the century, in 1912, when a geologist noted the presence of caves at the north end of Horne Lake. A few years later, when the area was opened up for logging, the loggers knew the location of the caves. It is not known if the loggers ventured into the depths of the caves but a stream in one of the caves was dammed to provide water for the steam donkeys used in early logging practices.<br> <br> It was not until 1939 that the caves gained public attention. Two cave explorers were responsible for rediscovering what they named the &ldquo;Horne Lake Wonder Caves&rdquo;. At this point only the Main and Lower Main Caves were known, although some speculated on the potential for more caves in the area. The presence of a noticeable air current at the mouth of Main Cave led people to believe there must be a system of caves, of which Main was just a part. In 1941, a storekeeper from Qualicum reported entering a sizable cave almost a quarter of a mile long, some distance from the already discovered caves. This was probably the    first discovery of Riverbend Cave.<br> <br> By 1945, the caves had become a known tourist stop for people looking for adventure. This increased use of the caves, however, took its toll and by    the summer of 1945 a party of explorers noted that many of the once beautiful formations were either broken or removed by souvenir seekers. This same party found the storekeeper&rsquo;s cave, Riverbend.<br> <br> In 1957, the Horne Lake Caves area of approximately 29 hectares was established as a recreation reserve in an effort to ensure opportunities for the public to continue to view these caves in the future. Six years later a group of cavers from Victoria discovered the two entrances to Eggshell Cave. The value of this area was recognized by members of the Canadian Speleological Society, who then approached the provincial government to have this area protected. Horne Lake Caves Provincial Park was established in February 1971. </li> <li> <strong>Conservation</strong> - In addition to protecting the karst features and caves, this park includes a forested addition that protects approximately 1 km of the Qualicum River adjacent to Horne Lake Caves. This forest provides a visual buffer for visitors to the existing park. The area also protects high fish and wildlife values. </li> </ul>",

At the end of the last ice age, some 11,000 years ago, winds from the main trench of the Fraser River and from, what is now, Kinbasket Lake, deposited vast quantities of sand in the Jackman Flats area. This created an ecosystem considered unique in  British Columbia. Rare plant communities and shifting sand dune structures now exist in this rather small park.<br> <br>Excellent recreational opportunities have been enjoyed by Robson Valley residents for many years in this special area. Unregulated motorized use, primarily from all-terrain vehicles, has had a devastating effect on not only the rare plant communities but on the structural integrity of the sand dunes.  The uniqueness of Jackman Flats can be quickly appreciated when one considers that one plant community, Juniperus-Stereocaulon, is found nowhere else in British Columbia.<br> <br>An extremely dry area, where drought conditions generally exist through the summer season, Jackman Flats is vulnerable to excessive recreation use. Hiking, and cross-country skiing are permitted on existing trails only. Excellent opportunities exist for bird watching and plant identification. The parks most prominent residents are the variety of lichen species that dominate the landscape. The fragile nature, distribution and abundance of these lichens can be preserved by staying on designated trails. Remember, to collect or damage any natural object in a provincial park is illegal.

Do not go to the beach to watch.</p></li><li><h5>Beach Safety and Tides</h5><p>Exposed beaches along Juan de Fuca Provincial Park are subject to &ldquo;rogue&rdquo; waves. Please show respect for surf and waves. Watch for unusually large rogue waves that occasionally hit the beach. These waves are capable of pulling a person into the water. Keep children away from the surf.</p><p>Watch for orange balls as you hike, they mark an exit from the beach to the trail. Beaches may be cutoff from the trail during high tides and storms.</p><p>Tide tables are posted at trailheads and available at local bookstores. Use Canadian Tide Tables &ldquo;Port Renfrew&rdquo; section. Remember to use the PDT (Pacific Daylight Savings Time) for tidal times during March to November, as Daylight Savings Time is in effect. Visitors should reference the <a href=\"http://www.waterlevels.gc.ca/eng\" target=\"_blank\">Fisheries and Oceans tide table for Port Renfrew, Vancouver Island, British Columbia</a>.</p></li><li><h5>Juan de Fuca Marine Trail</h5><p>The Juan de Fuca Marine Trail is designed as a <strong> wilderness hiking trail</strong>. Hiking conditions are always changing and hikers should get up-to-date information before hiking. Additional advisories may be posted at the trailhead information shelters. Your fitness, knowledge, skills and equipment must meet the challenges of the area. All hikers in your group must be prepared for at least the following:</p><ul><li>rugged, uneven ground and slippery conditions on muddy trails, wooden surfaces, boulders and rockyshorelines.</li><li>wading creeks, negotiate steep slopes, climb embankments, and follow an irregular trail.</li><li>damaged structures, wear and tear, storms and other factors may quickly change their condition.</li><li>be prepared for rain &amp; damp mists - incidents of hypothermia and physical injury increase significantly during prolonged wet period.</li><li>accidents and injuries. It may take hours before help arrives if an accident occurs.</li></ul><p>Hikers are advised to leave a plan of their trip, including which trail they are hiking, and arrival and departure times with a friend or relative.</p></li><li><h5>Bear Safety</h5><p>This park is prime habitat for bears. Please be bear aware &amp; check out the <a href=\"/explore/misc/bears/\">Bear and Cougar Safety Guide</a>. Remember, <strong>A fed bear is a dead bear.</strong></p></li></ul><h4>Special Notes</h4><ul>   <li><h5>Transport</h5><p>The Juan de Fuca Trail does not connect to the West Coast Trail, part of Pacific Rim National Park Reserve.

Preservation of a living legacy of unprecedented natural beauty, accessible to all, was considered a fitting tribute to the spirit of the Games.<br>Construction and preservation of the Trail has been made possible by the efforts of government, local industries, First Nations and citizens. Land exchanges and gifts of land have come from Western Forest Products and Timber West. Trail upgrades have been undertaken with funding from Forest Renewal BC and the Environment Youth Team (E-Team).<br>The Juan de Fuca Marine Trail was originally part of a lifesaving trail that serviced this area, known at the time as the Graveyard of the Pacific.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park protects significant marine tidal pool life at Botanical Beach as well as black bear and cougar habitat. The region is so biologically significant that the University of Minnesota installed the first marine research station in the Pacific Northwest at Botanical Beach in 1901. Since then, the area has been used for research by a number of universities in BC and Washington. Red, purple and orange starfish and sea urchins, white gooseneck barnacles, blue mussels and green seas anemones and sea cucumbers only begin to hint at the colourful spectrum of intertidal life thriving here.<br>Do not harvest shellfish or other plants and animals.

Khutzeymateen/K&rsquo;tzim-a-deen Grizzly Bear Sanctuary] was established as a Class A Park in 1994 as the first area in Canada to be protected specifically for grizzly bears and their habitat. Class A parks are dedicated to the preservation of their natural environments for the inspiration, use and enjoyment of the public.</p> <p>The park represents the first undisturbed estuary of its size to be protected along the north coast of BC. The topography of this land and marine sanctuary is diverse, with rugged peaks towering to 2100 metres above a valley of wetlands, old growth temperate rainforests and a large river estuary. An abundance of wildlife shares the area.</p> <p>          The Khutzeymateen Inlet Conservancy was established in 2008 to further enhance and ensure protection of key grizzly bear intertidal and foreshore habitats throughout the inlet. A conservancy is set aside for four reasons:       </p> <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha;\"> <li> The protection and maintenance of their biological diversity and natural environments; </li> <li> The preservation and maintenance of social, ceremonial and cultural uses of First Nations; </li> <li> The protection and maintenance of their recreational values; and, </li> <li> To ensure that development or use of their natural resources occurs in a sustainable manner consistent with the purposes of paragraphs (a), (b) and (c). </li> </ol> <p>The Khutzeymateen group of protected areas continues to play a key role in the conservation of grizzly bears in North America by protecting a large part of the ecosystem in which they live. Grizzly bears depend on a healthy and fully functioning ecosystem which supports a variety of animals and fish.</p> <p>Coast Tsimshian First Nations depend upon this area, as they have for thousands of years, as the source of their social, economic and cultural prosperity.

In addition, the lands adjacent to the protected areas are also closed to Grizzly Bear harvest as part of the Nass-Skeena Grizzly Bear No Hunting Area7.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The ultimate purpose of this area is to protect the north coast grizzly bear by the ecosystems in which they live. These protected areas include an entire intact coastal watershed (Khutzeymateen-Kateen Rivers) and much of the land surrounding a fjord that contains a very high density of Grizzly Bears, with over 50 individual bears seen in one season. Such abundance is due to the high quality Grizzly Bear habitat in the area consisting of forbs and sedges (Lyngby&rsquo;s sedge) and Pacific Salmon spawning streams. Features associated with the bears include bear mark trails, rubbing trees and wallows.</li> </ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> The first settlers to pre-empt land in this area were farmers, one of whom started milling lumber in 1870. From 1870 to 1910, a succession of sawmills came into operation and with them, the community grew. Thomas Kilby came to Harrison Mills in 1902 and by 1904, had built a three-story building consisting of a general store and hotel. His son, Acton and wife, Jessie ran this operation until their retirement in 1976. The Provincial Government acquired this area. Today, the general store is a museum and is operated by the Ministry responsible for Tourism. The beach area has been developed into a riverside park with 22 campsites, a small day-use area, and a boat launch under the jurisdiction of BC Parks.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> The Harrison and Fraser Rivers served as major transportation routes for the local First Nations population. In the mid to late 1800s, the Fraser River and Cariboo gold rushes created considerable activity along the Harrison River, near the site of this historic park.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park lies within the Coastal Western Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone and is representative of the Fraser floodplain landscape. Upland vegetation includes cottonwood, poplar, alder, and willow while the understory consists largely of red currant and salmonberry.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Kilby Provincial Park is a designated British Columbia Wildlife Watch area. It is an excellent location to view large concentrations of wintering Bald Eagles as well as graceful trumpeter swans that migrate to the area from Alaska. Other common bird species to the park area include ravens, geese, eagles, swans, finches, chickadees and jays.

The location of the bridge site, near a hairpin turn on the river, forced construction of a curved right-of-way. Engineers developed this 190 foot wooden bridge with a super elevated (banked) nine degree curve to conform with the bend of the highway.</p>      <p>       Contracted by a Canadian company, construction of this engineering marvel took nine months to complete.

This zone occurs at low to mid-elevations. In general, it is one of the wettest areas in BC and typically has cool summers and mild winters. Mean annual precipitation ranges from 100-440 cm. The park is situated on an active floodplain of the Kitimat River. Vegetation differences throughout the park depend on differences in bench height and frequency of flooding. The soils in active floodplains are usually poorly developed. <br>       <br>       High bench sites have seasonally fluctuating water tables, but only flood every few years. Forests are typically dominated by Sitka Spruce, however Red Cedar, Western Hemlock and Amabilis Fir are also present. The shrub layer is dominated by Devil&rsquo;s Club. Small amounts of Salmonberry, Alaskan and Oval-leaf Blueberry and young conifers are also present in the understory. Spiny Wood Fern, Oak Fern, Foamflowers, Twisted Stock, and leafy mosses are also common in this plant community. <br>       <br>       Middle bench plant communities have high and prolonged water tables that limit conifer establishment. The most common species in this area are Black Cottonwood, Red-Osier Dogwood, Red Alder, and Salmonberry. <br>       <br>       The low bench plant communities are found adjacent to the river and back channels and are subjected to prolonged annual flooding, sediment erosion and deposition. The occasional Black Cottonwood is found in this area, but the most common species are willows along with Red and Sitka Alder. </li>      </ul>",

Eulachon oil from the Pacific Coast was rendered and carried in cedar boxes along this route, often referred to as the Grease Trail. Dried fish, cedar-bark and berries from the coast were also traded for moose hides, beaver and obsidian from the interior.  Many Indigenous people from the Southern Carrier Nation lived seasonally along sections of the trail and continue to do so today. Archaeological research has  identified prehistoric sites near or on the trail, with evidence of stone tool use or manufacture and recognized heritage values that go back thousands of years.<br> <br>Members of the Southern Carrier Nation guided Alexander Mackenzie on this trail in 1793, during his search to find a trade route to the Pacific Coast for the Northwest Company. Mackenzie was the first European to cross North America. Kluskoil Lake Park encompasses only a short portion of the Heritage  Trail. Mackenzie and his party of nine men camped in what is now the park, beside the Blackwater River west of Kluskoil Lake, on July 8th, 1793.</li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> A very rough road runs through the park and sections of it travel over the Alexander Mackenzie Heritage Trail.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> Kokanee Creek Park is located on theold &ldquo;Busk&rdquo; estate site. Charles W. Busk was a wealthy English gentleman who came to Nelson in the late 1800&rsquo;s.He had acquired a large tract of land with lake frontage 14 miles fromNelson. From plans drawn by English architects, Busk built a large mansionthat once sat on a rise a short way up Kokanee Glacier Road. As a countrysquire and gracious gentlemen, Mr. Busk enjoyed entertaining guests butalso had many interests in surveying, mining, fruit ranching and Scouting.He lived an eloquent, lavish life style. After 1913 the romance of hisnew way of life had dulled and it is estimated he went through threefortunes. Sadly, within a few years he died, disillusioned by most ofhis ventures, withdrawn and ignored by friends whom he once had entertainedso lavishly. The park as it is seen today was originally establishedin 1955.</li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Archaeological evidence in the park indicates seasonal campsites used by First Nations people. Remains of European settlement include evidence of old homesteads and an early estate. Nearby are mining ghost towns and village museums displaying the Kootenay area history.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> With 257 hectares, Kokanee CreekPark has extensive sandy beaches and a large delta area. Backed by a gentlerising upland, this area gives way to the forested slopes of the Slocan Rangeof the Selkirk Mountains. Kokanee Creek bisects the landscape to form a steepcanyon. The park protects the active alluvial creek fan with its marshes andextensive sandspit. Both the Englemann spruce/subalpine fir and the interiorcedar/hemlock biogeoclimatic zones occur here. Prime growing conditions withinthe park produce a diverse mix of vegetation with magnificent specimens offir, hemlock and pine. There are both pure and mixed stands of deciduoustrees as well as many of the common understory plants including wildrose, queen&rsquo;s cup and skunk cabbage. Flowers, trees and shrubs are partof the park&rsquo;s natural heritage, please do notdamage or remove them.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The Kokanee Creek Delta ecology includesmany species of plants and animals. A variety of habitats support coyotes,beaver, whitetail and mule deer and a large number of birds ranging from thetiny Rufous hummingbird to the great blue heron. Many of the birds are migratorybut kingfishers, woodpeckers and dippers can by seen throughout the year.

Sitting mostly above 1,800 metres in elevation, the park has two glaciers &ndash; Kokanee and Woodbury &ndash; which feed over 30 lakes and are the headwaters of many creeks.</p>     <p>Kokanee Lake is 1,200 metres in length and 400 metres wide; surrounded by precipitous cliffs and rock slides, it is an alpine jewel. Other scenic lakes in the park include the gem-coloured Sapphire Lakes, milky Joker Lakes and popular Gibson, Kaslo and Tanal Lakes, which offer good fishing for    rainbow and cutthroat trout. With 85 km of well-marked trails, this park is appropriate for campers, hikers and climbers with all levels of outdoor    experience.</p>     <p>Kokanee Glacier Provincial Park, set aside in 1922, is one of the oldest major parks in the provincial system. It has a long history of well established recreational use and is perhaps the best known alpine park in the Kootenay area of British Columbia. Its boundaries encompass 32,035 hectares of some of the most scenic mountain country found in the Selkirk Mountains of southern British  Columbia, comprising a picturesque mosaic of high peaks, snowfields, cirques and colourful lake basins.</p>     <p>As the dominant feature and roughly in the park&rsquo;s centre, Kokanee Glacier forms the culmination of mountain ridges and valleys leading in from Kootenay and Slocan Lake. Slowly regenerating burns, old growth spruce stands, open slide paths and meadowlands lend contrast and heighten the beauty of the Park&rsquo;s mountain landscape.</p>     <p>Access to the park was developed from old mining and forestry roads. Leading from these various road ends, trails dating to the early mining developments offer a variety of hiking opportunities ranging from short day trips to challenging cross-country routes; for the status of the main access routes please <a href=\"trail_report.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Check the most recent trail report <span class=\"fileinfo\">[PDF]</span></a>. Historical cabins and interesting old mine sites combine with many natural features including peaks, lakes and alpine basins to form a rich and diverse environment for back-country recreation.</p>     <p>The park straddles the crest of mountain ridges between Slocan Lake and Kootenay Lake. Located 30 kilometres to the northeast, the peaks of Kokanee  Glacier are visible from the city of Nelson, and stand out as dominant skyline features from many points on Kootenay Lake.</p>     <p>Weather patterns in the park are typical of the Southern Interior Mountains, With the whole Park area over 1,500 metres, elevation strongly influences weather conditions and while warm spells occur in July and August, Park visitors should be aware of the highly changeable nature of mountain weather. Snow and sleet are not uncommon in summer, and rainy weather, many times in the form of thunderstorms, can be expected in the spring, summer and autumn months.</p>     <p>The heavy snowfall accumulations in the Park can be counted upon to ensure excellent ski conditions from late autumn to early spring. Snow can occur in October at all levels in the Park and the higher elevations are not likely to be snow-free until July. Avalanches are prevalent on the open alpine slope, limiting ski touring possibilities to certain routes and to low risk periods.</p>     <p><strong>Date Established: </strong>February 6, 1922      <br>      <strong>Park Size:</strong> 32,035 hectares     </p>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>    <li><strong>History:</strong> Established in 1922, this is one of the oldest parks in the province. Geologically, this area is composed of an immense system of granite rock known as the Nelson batholith. During the earth&rsquo;s cooling process, slower-cooling mineralized solutions was subjected to great pressure that caused them to be pushed into holes and cracks in this granite mass. These became the deposits and finger-like veins, rich in gold and silver ore that caused the local mining boom at the end of the 19th century. Several mines paid quite well but most were worked for only a few years. Many of the park&rsquo;s trails were originally built for miners hauling ore and supplies. Today we can only marvel at the tenacity of those prospectors, who clung to steep rock faces throughout the park while trying to scratch a living from their mining claims.</li>       <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park&rsquo;s primary roles are to:        <ul>   <li>Represent sub-alpine, alpine landscapes and associated ecological resources of the Selkirk Mountain ranges.</li>        <li>Conserve grizzly bear and mountain goat habitat.</li>        <li>Maintain the characteristics and qualities of the natural environment and associated features, and</li>        <li>Conserve cultural heritage of the early alpine mining history of the West Kootenays.</li>       </ul></li>      <li><strong>Vegetation:</strong> Vegetation is typical of this elevation, with exposed bedrock and gravel moraine near the peaks where only lichens and a few other hardy plants survive. Stunted Engelmann spruce and white-bark pine are common at the timberline, with beautiful sub-alpine flower meadows in the wetter areas. The numerous steep slopes and avalanche paths support slide alder and huckleberry. The lower, more protected slopes are forested with Engelmann spruce, subalpine fir, lodgepole pine, hemlock and western red cedar. The few pure stands of subalpine larch are particularly stunning in October when their needles turn golden-yellow in the fading sun.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Bird species such as the blue grouse and Franklin grouse inhabit the forests, and ptarmigan are often seen in the open areas. Golden eagles are occasionally seen soaring majestically overhead. Small animals such as the hoary marmot, pika, ground squirrels, and marten are    common, while larger species such as the mountain goat, mule deer and black bear are present in lesser numbers. The park contains most of the range for several grizzly bears, and further protection of significant grizzly bear habitat was the main reason for the expansion of the park in 1995. Separation of people and grizzlies is an important management objective - for the protection of both parties. To protect these endangered bears, areas such as the Coffee Creek drainage have no development and use is discouraged. Other trails are carefully designed to avoid bear habitat or closed at certain times of the year when bears are known to be feeding on ripe berries nearby.       <ul>        <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>        </ul>      </li>      </ul>",

			"locationNotes": "<ul> <li> <a href=\"/explore/map.html\">Location Map</a> </li> </ul> Located northwest of Kamloops, there are two main ways to reach Lac du Bois Grasslands protected area by vehicle (refer to the map in the brochure): <ul> <li> A: <strong>Lac du Bois Road</strong> in the east takes the visitor through the full sweep of the grasslands. From the intersection of Fortune Drive and Tranquille Road, take 8th Street north through two sets of traffic lights. At the overpass, move into the left-hand lane and turn straight ahead up the hill between the subdivisions. At the cattle guard the surface changes to gravel and is a good, but narrow, well-traveled road. Expect to meet logging trucks and school buses. </li> <li> B: In the west, <strong>Tranquille-Criss Creek Forest Service Road</strong> (also known as Red Lake Road) rises steeply to the Dewdrop Range and the deep canyon of Tranquille Valley. From the intersection of Fortune Drive and Tranquille Road, follow Tranquille Road past the airport towards Tranquille. Turn right over the railway tracks and around the fields before crossing the Tranquille River and going up the long, gradual hill. At the sharp blind 180 degree turn, there are two choices: go straight ahead to Dewdrop Flats and the red lava cliffs of Dewdrop Range; or go around the corner and up the hill to follow the spectacular Tranquille canyon. Expect to meet logging trucks and other local traffic. </li> </ul> Two other roads give vehicle access to the protected area, each leading into a different type of scenery: <ul> <li> <strong>Long Lake Road:</strong> From the ATV area on the Lac du Bois Road, Long Lake Road winds its way through the grasslands to the forests past rolling hills and small ponds. It is a narrow, dirt track, steep in places; closed during winter and spring break-up or during adverse conditions that would affect the stability of the road. </li> <li> <strong>Dairy Creek Road:</strong> To get to the north edge of the protected area, take this logging road that runs through Douglas fir forest and beside deeply entrenched streams. It can be reached by following Westsyde Road. It is a narrow, gravel road steep in places; an alternative route when weather conditions permit. It connects to the north end of the Long Lake Road and eventually connects to the Lac du Bois Road. There are many junctions along the way so a good map is essential. </li> </ul> <p> The road lying to the west of Wheeler Mountain is deeply rutted and partly washed out in places. It is not recommended for public use. </p> <p> Vehicle access is limited to only those roads shown on the map; all other trails are closed to motorized vehicles. Not all roads are passable by two-wheel drive, low-clearance vehicles and weather conditions may severely change driving conditions. </p>",

There are many stories to explain how the lake was named; according to one, it gained its name when a trapper lost his only hatchet axe when chopping a hole in the frozen lake. This area is rich in tales of fur traders, gold seekers and cattle ranchers. By the 1860&rsquo;s, gold fever was running high, as miners searched for the motherlode first near Likely, and later at Barkerville. With teams of horses, mules and oxen, the fortune-seekers plodded north along the Cariboo Wagon Road skirting the eastern shores of the lake.    </p>    <p>     Nowadays, Lac La Hache Park is a stopping point for weary travellers. Set amongst a stately Douglas-fir forest, the cool, green conifers shade campers from the hot Cariboo sun. Lac La Hache Park is located on Highway 97, 13 km north of the community of Lac La Hache. Established in 1956, with 83 campsites, flush toilets, tap water, a sani-station and a self-guided nature trail, Lac La Hache Park is a very pleasant campground. The day-use area is located across Highway 97 on the shore of Lac La Hache and has an adventure playground, picnic tables, picnic shelter, boat launch, developed beach, changehouse and flush toilets.    </p>    <p>     This is an excellent fishing lake for Kokanee and lake trout, as well as rainbow trout and burbot during the summer months. However, fishing need not be your only recreational pursuit, as the lake is also a popular place for power boating and water-skiing.    </p>    <p>     The Heritage House at 108 Mile is a half-hour&rsquo;s drive from the campground, and is open from May to September. The campground host or <a href=\"#contact\">Park Operator</a> can inform you of other things to do in the area, as well as boat rental locations. The community of Lac La Hache offers a grocery store, gas station, bakery, ice cream parlour and a few restaurants.    </p>    <p>     <strong>Established Date:</strong> March 16, 1956<br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 24 hectares    </p>    <table class=\"hours\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\">     <tr><th colspan=\"2\"> Campground Dates of Operation<div class=\"note\">All dates are subject to change without notice</div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"40%\"><strong>Opening and Closing Campground Dates:</strong><br>(campground is accessible but may not offer full services such as water,security, etc.) </td><td width=\"60%\">May 15 &ndash; September 30(gate is closed during off-season but access to boat launch until October11) </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Campground Dates with Full Services and Fees:</strong> </td><td>May 15 &ndash; September 30</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Campground Reservable Dates:</strong> </td><td>May 15 &ndash; September 3</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Number of Vehicle Accessible Campsites: </strong></td><td>83</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of Reservable Campsites, if applicable:</strong><br>(all remaining sites are first-come, first-served) </td><td>30</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Note:</strong> The above information isfor the campground only.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> The historic Cariboo Wagon road runs through the park. This was originally just a trail used by fur    traders from 1803 to 1810. During the Cariboo Gold Rush of the 1860&rsquo;s it was rebuilt, and it linked the gold fields of the Cariboo to the gold markets of the world, via the shipyards of Vancouver. One of the stops on the park&rsquo;s Interpretive Trail is on the actual Wagon Road. The overgrown track seems a far cry from our modern Highway 97.<br>One of the stopping points on the Wagon Road for weary miners was the Blue Tent Ranch. It was built by the Wright family in 1862, after they    discovered that cattle and the roadhouse provided a much steadier income than gold mining. The present day park is located on part of the original    ranch land. Throughout the park, you can see the stumps from the lumber used to build the original ranch house. This heritage house still stands    today, and can be seen next to the highway, roughly three kilometres north of the park.Lac La Hache was established as a Class A Provincial Park in 1956.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Both the Shuswap and Chilcotin First Nations used the area. Long before the lure of wealth brought the fur traders west, the Shuswap Indians established pit houses near the present day village of Lac La Hache. The Chilcotins named the lake Kumatakwa, meaning Chief or Queen of the waters.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park is in the Interior Douglas Fir Zone, which is found in BC&rsquo;s dry interior. There is a superb old-growth stand of Douglas-fir trees surrounding the campground. A fire in the 1960&rsquo;s burned several hectares, and you can still see the scars on the bases of some fir trees, their thick bark allowed these trees to survive. Fire is part of natural succession here &ndash; sunlight reaching the forest floor allows the growth of trembling aspen and lodgepole pine, as well as pinegrass, bunchberry and beautiful pink wild roses. </li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Birds that thrive in this lakeside habitat include bald eagle, osprey and red-tailed hawk, as well as forest birds such as pileated woodpeckers, saw-whet owls, red crossbills, chickadees and nuthatches.<br>       Because of the diversity in plant species, a wide variety of mammals lives in this area, from moose and black bears to humble shrews and chipmunks.    There are also mule deer, pine martin, lynx, and flying squirrels.        <ul>         <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>        </ul>      </li>      </ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> Lakelse Lake Wetlands Provincial Park was designated as a park on May 20, 2004, following recommendations from the Kalum Land and Resource Management Plan.</li>       <li><p><strong>Conservation:</strong> Lakelse Lake Wetlands Park protects a biologically exceptional and Provincially significant warm-water wetland complex. Warm water springs in the Lakelse Lake Wetlands drain into Lakelse Lake, the largest warm water lake in northwestern BC. Clearwater and Andalas Creeks have open water throughout the winter. The streams are fed by warm water springs along an escarpment above the creeks.       </p>      <p>       The bog ecosystem in the Lakelse Lake Wetlands is regionally significant. It contains scattered and stunted Lodgepole Pine, Western Redcedar, and Western Hemlock. In addition to water loving shrubs and herbs, the bogs contain specialized plants such as sundews, tall white bog orchids and bog club-moss. Accumulations of moss and organic material are often greater than 100cm and water tables are within 20cm of the surface.</p>      <p>       The south end of Lakelse Lake contains the most extensive cover of emergent and submerged aquatic plants remaining in Lakelse Lake.       Dominant plants include Swamp horsetail in water to 1m and reeds in water to 4m in depth. The band of vegetation extends from Schulbuckhand Creek, on the east side of the park, to the outlet of the Lakelse River in the west. The aquatic vegetation has established on shallows built up by sediments from inflowing streams (Schulbuckhand, Clearwater, Andalas, and Ena Creeks). The aquatic vegetation is stabilized by the constant replenishment of sediments and nutrients that are carried in the streams.       </p>      <p>       The park also contains regionally significant valley bottom old growth stands. Valley bottom old growth in the Kitimat Valley is relatively rare and a special feature. Several small stands are located in the northwest corner, between Andalas and Clearwater Creek and on the southeast boundary of the park. Mature and old-growth forests commonly found on higher ground in the Lakelse Lake &ndash; Lakelse River area are very productive and contain Western hemlock, Sitka Spruce (largest trees in stand), and Western redcedar. Shrub cover is dense and is dominated by Devil&rsquo;s Club, Salmonberry, and Oval-leaf huckleberry. Herbs are well developed, but the moss layer is thin.       </p>      </li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Lakelse Lake Wetlands Park contains internationally significant salmon spawning and rearing habitat and critical habitat for over-wintering steelhead. The large reed beds around the southern shoreline of Lakelse Lake and the streams that run through the alluvial fans and wetlands provide prime fish habitat. Steelhead over-winter in the reed beds. The warm water of Clearwater Creek support a late fall Coho run. Lakelse Lake and its tributaries are important to sockeye salmon. Sockeye salmon rear for a year within the lake prior to migrating to the sea the following April. Typically, 500,000 plus sockeye fry rear in the lake with 5-10,000 sockeye returning to the lake every fall. Although, in recent years as few as 1,000 adult spawners have returned. Consequently, Lakelse sockeye salmon are subject to a recovery strategy. The quality of water that drains through the wetlands is critical to the Lakelse River fishery. The water drains into the lake through the wetlands and out the Lakelse River, which drains from the southwest corner of the lake, approximately 0.5 km from the northern boundary of the park. <br>       <br>       The wetlands also contain regionally significant waterfowl habitat that is of great importance to migratory and over-wintering waterfowl. Trumpeter Swan (a provincially blue-listed/threatened species) over-winter and nest in the wetlands. There are reports of more than 100 swans wintering in the wetlands. Swans stay in the area from early winter to spring and breeding occurs in the wetlands. Geese and ducks feed and rest in the wetlands and in the reed beds at the south end of the lake. <br>       <br>       Grizzly and Black Bears use the corridor from Clearwater Lakes along Clearwater Creek to the wetlands. Grizzlies use the east side of the park in the spring (to feed on shrubs) and fall (to feed on salmon). One of the regions highest seasonal (fall) concentrations of Grizzlies is found along Clearwater Creek. Grizzly Bear density varies with the size of the salmon run. Historically there was a large seasonal population of Grizzly Bears in the wetland. Grizzlies were known to stay in the area until December, feeding on the late Coho runs in Coldwater Creek. Occasionally, after the late feeding, Grizzlies denned in the wetlands because snow accumulations prevented them from getting to their usual denning areas. The Cecil Creek drainage, west of the park, is a crossing zone for Grizzlies from four different populations. The Grizzly Bears breed in this area and cubs are often reared in the wetland. <br>       <br>       The wetlands are also an important seasonal habitat for Black Bear, Wolf, Beaver and other small furbearers. Some of the Black Bears in the area are subspecies Ursus americanus kermodei, (white phase). Black Bear use of the area is very high. The bears forage on Pacific Crab-apple and salmon.       <ul>        <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>        </ul>      </li>     </ul>",

On the south side you will find the largest Douglas firs &ndash; one measuring more than 9 metres in circumference. On the northern side of the road you&rsquo;ll find groves of ancient Western red cedar standing sentry over nearby Cameron Lake.     </p>     <p>     The park has been restoring some of its trails after a severe windstorm on New Year&rsquo;s Day in 1997, which changed the look of the park forever. The storm toppled hundreds of huge trees and obliterated sections of the trail system. Some sections of the trail system were so badly hit that they have never been reopened. Restoration and cleanup began almost as soon as the winds stopped, and although visitors will now find many of these huge trees lying on the ground, their value has not diminished. These fallen trees open the canopy to provide light, space, shelter and nutrients for the next generations of plants. Natural regeneration is beginning to restore the Grove&rsquo;s pristine beauty and the park&rsquo;s diversity, making a visit to Cathedral Grove all the more intriguing.     </p>     <p>     Improvements to MacMillan Park can be supported by &ldquo;feeding&rdquo; the donation tree next to the main trail; your contributions will be used for youth team trail projects, volunteer projects, revegetation projects and new signs.

This colourful description of the stately trees is reputed to have originated from the Governor General Viscount Willingdon in April 1928. Cathedral Grove was a well-known tourist stop on the Alberni Road in the 1920s and 1930s when the timber was owned by the Victoria Lumbering and Manufacturing Company. For 15 years the public encouraged the provincial government to acquire the lands within Block 35, Cameron Lake area. The citizens&rsquo; organizations, The Associated Boards of Trade of Vancouver Island, petitioned the government in 1929 to preserve forever, for the public benefit, the well-known stand of timber at Cameron Lake, known as Cathedral Grove. In 1944 H.R. MacMillan, a well-known forester donated the 136 hectares of land for the perpetual enjoyment of the public in recognition of the unique stand of trees. Three years later, the area was established as a Class A provincial park.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park protects and preserves an internationally significant representative example of Douglas fir old-growth forest within the East Vancouver Island and the Coastal Douglas fir Biogeoclimatic Zone.</li>    <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Many species of wildlife use the old-growth forest as their home including several types of woodpeckers, owls, insects, reptiles, amphibians, deer, elk, black bear and cougar.

Under the Cariboo-Chilcotin Land-use Plan, uses that were permitted before 1995 will continue in the park: livestock grazing, hunting, trapping and guiding. In 2013, 2,215 hectares were added to the park as part of the Cariboo-Chilcotin Land-use Plan (special feature) process.</li>       <li><strong>Cultural Heritage</strong> - Marble Range Park is within the traditional territory of the Shuswap People. Three First Nations continue to use the park for sustenance, spiritual and cultural purposes. If you find any First Nations heritage sites, do not disturb them or remove anything - they are protected under the<em> Heritage Conservation Act.</em> </li>       <li><strong>Conservation</strong> - The principal reasons for the protection of the Marble Range area were for: the preservation of alpine and subalpine habitats in the Pavillion Ranges Ecosection (PAR), the preservation of endangered and non-endangered wildlife and their habitat (e.g., bighorn sheep, mule deer and cougar) and for high back-country recreation values. The park is located within the Pavilion Ranges, and protects mostly mid- to high elevation ecosystems. The forests contain old growth Douglas-fir, spruce, lodgepole and whitebark pine, ranging into subalpine parklands and extensive alpine tundra. The karst topography is unusual in BC, and is protected in only a few other parks, mostly on Vancouver Island. Soils in the area are high in calcium, so they support a number of rare    plants.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife</strong> - Wildlife viewing is popular in the Marble Range. Please remember your binoculars and telephoto lenses, as keeping your distance will minimize disturbance to the California bighorn sheep and other animals. The park, along with the nearby <a href=\"../edge_hills/\">Edge Hills Park</a> provides important habitat for species that require large, diverse ecosystems, such as cougar and black bear. The Marble Range is excellent as mule deer summer range. Every year, California bighorn sheep migrate between alpine areas in the Marble Range and steep cliffs of the Fraser River canyon in Edge Hills Provincial Park. The migration is dictated by food availability. Sheep will winter in the warmth of the canyon, where tender green shoots begin to grow early in the season. Here, the sheep also encounter less snow, and have access to steep and rugged terrain for protection from predators. In early summer, the sheep migrate to alpine areas in the Marble Range. Over the past 40 to 50 years, many of these routes have been abandoned, with only a few routes remaining. A three year study has been initiated by the Clinton and District Outdoor Sportsmen Association in order to determine exactly where the migration routes are. The results will assist in future management decisions.</li>      <li><a href=\"../../wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>     </ul>",

All sedentary marine life, including abalones,  scallops and sea cucumbers, are fully protected within the park&rsquo;s boundaries, which extend 300 metres out from the shore. This nature reserve is an important nesting colony for thousands of Glaucous-winged Gulls, as well as Pelagic Cormorants, Pigeon Guillemots, Black Oystercatchers and many other species of birds. Marine life around the island includes river otters and harbour seals throughout the year, and Steller&rsquo;s and California sea lions from late fall through to summer.<br><br>Mitlenatch, which means &ldquo;calm waters all around&rdquo; in the Coast Salish language, is a small rocky island that features semi-arid conditions caused by the island&rsquo;s location in the &ldquo;rain shadow&rdquo; of Vancouver Island. The park receives less than 75 cm (30 inches) of rain each year &ndash; about half the Campbell River average. Rain-bearing clouds pass eastward from the Pacific Ocean and drop much of their moisture on Vancouver Island. As they descend across the Strait of Georgia, they warm and pick up new moisture, which will be dropped on the Coast Mountains of mainland British Columbia.<br><br>Accessible by boat only, Mitlenatch Island Nature Provincial Park offers excellent opportunities to observe and photograph wildflowers and birds. Visit in May when the island&rsquo;s meadows of spring wildflowers are in bloom, or in late May to July when the harvest brodia blooms and in the last half of June when the coastal cactus bloom. Birders should approach the observation blind as a group, slowly and quietly, this may help to reduce the birds&rsquo; anxiety and allow you to observe their behaviour and &ldquo;family life&rdquo; more easily.<br><br>The island is a very sensitive ecosystem that is extremely prone to damage by visitors who venture off the designated trails. Pets are not permitted on the island.<br><br>Collecting of any kind is NOT permitted at Mitlenatch Island, including all shellfish.<br><br>",

It was also known as &ldquo;the lake with a hole through it&rdquo; or &ldquo;the lake with no bottom.&rdquo; There is a legend that is often told of an ancient creature that surfaces from time to time a long, long time ago.</p><p>The lake was named for Harry Moberly, chief trader with the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company.

In 1870, he rejoined the Company to complete a total of 37 years of faithful service.</p>   </li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Moberly Provincial Park is covered with a fairly dense stand of white spruce interspersed with trembling aspen and balsam poplar.

Smaller mammals like the red squirrel, snowshoe hare, muskrat and beaver are more likely to be seen. More than 25 species of birds including the common loon, bald eagle, American kestrel, spotted sandpiper, herring gull and belted kingfisher have been recorded in the park.</p><p>Moberly Lake and the Peace River district are very special areas for songbirds. The black-capped chickadee, Tennessee warbler, red-eyed vireo, red-winged blackbird, Wilson&rsquo;s warbler, white crowned sparrow, purple finch, dark-eyed junco, American robin, Swainson&rsquo;s thrush, yellow warbler and American redstart are just some songbirds can often be seen flitting among the willow and red-oiser dogwood that grown along the shores of the lake.</p><p>Moberly Lake is a productive lake for Northern pike, Arctic grayling, lake whitefish, lake and mountain whitefish, longnose sucker and white sucker.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> Monkman Provincial Park was named after Alex Monkman, an individual who expended a considerable amount of effort attempting to build a transportation route from the Peace River farming country down to the Pacific ports. In 1922, he and a group of fur trappers discovered what is now known as Monkman Pass. It was this pass that provided him with his vision for a railroad, a direct and economical route south. Failing to get government support for his venture, Monkman focused on the alternative--building a highway. The Monkman Pass Highway Association was formed in 1936, and over the next three years, many determined volunteers laboured to blaze this new trail. Limited funding, harsh conditions, and the outbreak of the Second World War eventually brought the project to a halt. A railway was later built to the northwest over the Pine Pass, and Monkman&rsquo;s &ldquo;highway&rdquo; slowly faded into historical obscurity. Today, only a few sections are visible along the <a href=\"camphike.html#trail\">Monkman Lake Trail</a>, a route that follows parts of the original road. The Brooks Falls in Monkman Provincial Park, was named after Carl Brooks, one of the volunteers who worked along with Alex Monkman and the Highway Association. A cairn marking overlooking the falls has been placed in his honour.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Lower elevations in the park are dominated by mature sub-alpine fir, white spruce and lodgepole pine. The higher elevations support growths of Englemann spruce, sub-alpine fir and white spruce. Above the treeline, only plants adapted to the conditions are to be found. Monkman Provincial Park conserves representative areas of the Central Rocky Mountains and Foothills. Lower elevations in the park are dominated by mature sub-alpine fir, white spruce and lodgepole pine. The higher elevations support growth of Engelmann spruce, sub-alpine fir and white spruce. Above treeline, the trees become dwarfed and twisted. Alpine meadows of heathers, grasses and wildflowers, such as white rhododendron, arctic lupine, glacier lily and Indian paintbrush cover large areas and are intermixed with shrubs.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The diverse range of habitat in Monkman Provincial Park supports grizzly and black bear, mountain goats, caribou  and moose. During the warmer seasons, deer, mountain sheep, gray wolves, fishers, martens, wolverines, marmots, hares, and red squirrels are joined by  numerous bird species that include owls, ptarmigan, grouse, geese and loons. Because of the fierce winter climate, most of the larger animals tend to seek a more hospitable range during the winter months.<br><br><a href=\"camphike.html#kinuseo\">Kinuseo Falls</a> presents an impassable obstacle to migrating fish, so fish habitat is not the same above and below the falls. Larger fish are able to follow the Murray River drainage from lower elevations to the falls. Above the falls, only small char, trout, grayling and whitefish inhabit the Murray River and upper Monkman Creek.</li></ul>",

White shell beaches, open meadows, tidal lagoons, towering forests, craggy headlands and abundant bird life are just a few of the things that attract visitors to this park in the southern Gulf Islands.</p>     <p>The park starts five metres below sea level and climbs 180 metres to a steep rocky precipice. Visitors can moor their boats to one of the 35 buoys in sheltered Montague Harbour or come by ferry and camp in one of the scenic vehicle-accessible or walk-in campsites. The park is the perfect place to enjoy a picnic or afternoon of exploration. Located within the park is Gray Peninsula, which was inhabited by First Nations peoples before the arrival of Spanish explorer Dionisio Galiano in 1792. Skirting the northwest edge of the peninsula is a spectacular rock ledge that was carved into rippling patterns by the movement of glaciers thousands of years ago.</p>     <p>Montague Harbour, with its sheltered waters and abundant salmon and shellfish, is heir to a rich history. The white shell beach on the north side of the park marks one of several shell middens &ndash; evidence of native occupation dating back more than 3,000 years. Castaway shells left by centuries of harvesting form berms on the foreshore in many areas of the park. Wave action erodes the middens, crushes the shells and redeposits them to create Montague&rsquo;s white shell beaches. Archaeological excavations of these protected middens have unearthed arrows, spearheads and stone carvings, helping to unravel the stories of earlier cultures.</p>     <p>Montague Harbour is a delight for outdoor enthusiasts and nature lovers in any season, but particularly during the long hot days of summer. Naturalists and bird watchers enjoy a climate and ecology found nowhere else, making Galiano Island a haven for many rare and protected plants and more than 130 species of birds. The waters around Montague Harbour attract flocks of wintering birds including diving ducks like scoters, buffleheads, goldeneyes and mergansers.</p>     <p><strong>Special Features:</strong>    On the northwest edge of Gray Peninsula is a spectacular rock ledge that was carved into rippling patterns by the movement of glaciers thousands of years ago. The park also features a salt water marsh between the main campground and Gray Peninsula, and evidence of First Nations culture that dates back more than 3,000 years. Middens are located in the north side of the park and in the harbour.</p>     <p><strong>Established Date:</strong> March 6, 1959<br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 102 hectares (70 hectares upland and 32 hectares foreshore).</p>     <p><strong>Special Notes:</strong>     <br>Middens are protected under BC law. Do not disturb these archaeological sites. Help protect them by accessing the beach using the stairs where ever possible.</p>     <p>In your exploration, please remember to carefully replace overturned rocks in their original position.

Castaway shells left by centuries of harvesting form berms on the foreshore in many areas of the park. Wave action erodes the middens, crushes the shells and redeposits them to create Montague&rsquo;s white shell beaches. Middens contain many of the archaeological clues that help to unravel the stories of earlier cultures. Middens are protected by law. Do not disturb these archaeological sites.</li>       <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> The arrival of the Spanish explorer, Captain Galiano, in 1792 marked the European discovery of the Gulf Islands. Montague Harbour, named for a naval officer, first appeared on a British surveying chart around 1859. Gray Peninsula was settled in the late 1890s by Captain Gray, who cultivated an orchard that supplied fruit to residents in Victoria. Remnants of this old orchard can still be found.</li>       <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Montague Park is rimmed by diverse shoreline &ndash; on the open shore, the shifting surface of sand and shells prevents large plants and animals from making their homes. Acorn barnacles grow in intertidal zones, together with the giant barnacle, edible mussel and Japanese oyster. At low tide scores of ochre sea stars can be seen on the rocks, feeding on barnacles, mussels and sea snails such as the whelk and periwinkle.<br>       A rich habitat of flora and fauna can be viewed in the small salt marsh on Gray&rsquo;s Peninsula. A lush mixture of Douglas fir, western    red cedar, grand fir and arbutus characterize the park. Skirting the northwest of the peninsula is a spectacular rock ledge that thousands of years ago was carved into rippling patterns by the movement of glaciers.</li>       <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The forest, rocky coastline and rich tidal lagoon attract many birds year-round. Great Blue Herons, glaucous-winged gulls, black oystercatchers, northwestern crows, belted kingfisher and bald eagles can often be seen scavenging and soaring over the seas in search of a meal. Horse clams, littleneck clams and butter clams find a safe sanctuary by burrowing beneath the shifting sands on the open shore.        <ul>         <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li>         </ul>       </li>       </ul>",

			"description": "<img src=\"moose6.jpg\" alt=\"Mooose Valley Provincial Park\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" class=\"park_photo\">     Moose Valley Provincial Park comprises 2,322 hectares of rolling landscape scattered with lakes and wetlands. The area was proposed for protection through the Cariboo public CORE process, and was originally designated a park through the Cariboo Chilcotin Land Use Plan in 1995. The park protects a chain of 12  small lakes, popular as a day or overnight canoeing destination. It is an idyllic place to visit, rewarding paddlers with clear, shallow lakes and abundant aquatic plants and flowers. The many tiny reed-fringed islands and surrounding marshes provide excellent habitat for deer, moose, waterfowl and amphibians.<br>     <br>Stuart Maitland, a local guide outfitter, first cleared and named portages linking the main lakes in the <a href=\"canoe.html\">Moose Valley Canoe Chain</a> in the early 1970s, with assistance from Hugh Kirkland and Kevin Marks. These three ambitious young men were in their late teens at the time, and independently sought government assistance to do the work. Today, the three main lakes in the chain are named after the youth who first developed the route. The route was later upgraded in 1987/88 by youth members of the Provincial Job Trac program.<br>     <br>The park is a wonderful place to spend leisure time canoeing, bird-watching, and wildlife viewing. Canoeing along the <a href=\"canoe.html\">Moose Valley Canoe Chain</a> is the primary recreational activity, and both day and overnight trips are popular. Camping areas are available at either end of the canoe route, but the only developed sites are located at the main access point at Marks Lake and at the north end of Maitland Lake. While the 1100 Road into Moose Valley isn&rsquo;t maintained in winter, the area is still a haven for cross-country skiing and snow-shoeing. A local outfitter offers one to two-day dog sled tours in the winter and guided canoe trips in the park.<br>     <br><strong>Special Features</strong>: Wetlands and sphagnum bogs can be accessed and viewed via canoe.<br>     <br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 2,500 hectares",

The lake was named after the Rev. Father Adrien-Gabriel Morice, author of &ldquo;The History of the Northern Interior of British Columbia,&rdquo; which describes his 20 years of explorations and missionary work in this area of the province.<br><br>The traditional Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en name is Wet-zuhn-buhn (pronounced wet-zin-bun), meaning the &ldquo;blueish-green colour of the water.&rdquo; Morice River is called Wet-zuhn-kwa. In the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en language &ldquo;Kwa&rdquo; refers to a river or stream, and &ldquo;buhn&rdquo; refers to a body of water like a lake.<br><br>The park is one of seven new parks and protected areas resulting from the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and associated government-to-government discussions with the Office of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en. Legislation of the park occurred in July, 2008.</li>      <li><strong>Culture:</strong> Morice Lake Provincial Park is located within the traditional territory of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en First Nation. Known as the people of the lower drainage, the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en have been living in this part of the continent since time immemorial. The park lies in the Lhudis Bin and C&rsquo;iniggit Nenik&euml;kh house territories within the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en territory. The Lhudis Bin house territory is in the house of Cas yex (Grizzly House) that belongs to the Gitdumden (Bear/Wolf) clan.

This remote park showcases a spectacular volcanic landscape that includes lava flows, basalt plateaus, cinder fields and cinder cones. At an elevation of 2,787 metres, Mount Edziza is an outstanding feature of this rugged and arresting domain.</p> <p>Mount Edziza, whose peak reaches 2,787 metres, is a composite volcano consisting of thin basalt flows and a central dome of andesite, dacite and rhyolite with a glaciated crater nearly 2,500 metres in diameter. The eruption that built the mountain and its central cone began four million years ago. Successive lava flows raised the dome above the encircling plateau and spread lava over an area 65 kilometres by 25 kilometres. The last basalt flow occurred only 10,000 years ago, at which time it solidified in place and plugged the central vent.</p> <p>In the years since Mount Edziza became dormant, numerous small eruptions have taken place around it, creating more than 30 cinder cones. Perfectly symmetrical Eve Cone rises 150 metres above the plateau, as do aptly named Coffee and Cocoa craters. It is estimated that these cones were formed no more than 1,300 years ago and are basically unaltered by erosion and devoid of vegetation.</p> <p>There are also five significant lakes within the park. Mowdade, Mowchilla, Kakiddi and Nuttlude form a chain along the eastern boundary, while Buckley Lake is on the northern border. All the lakes except Mowdade drain north into the Klastine River, a tributary of the Stikine.</p> <p>To the south, Raspberry Pass separates the Edziza area from the Spectrum Range. Formed from lava flows, these mountains are named for their brilliant red, yellow, white and purple rock.This altered rhyolite resulted from staining by sulphurous mineral waters. Subsequent erosion has resulted in the combination of many hues, giving the landscape the appearance of a vast water colour. There is no vehicle access to Mount Edziza Provincial Park, and there are only a very few basic facilities. This isolated wilderness area, which can only be accessed via trails or a float plane, offers <a href=\"hikecamp.html#hiking\">wilderness camping, hiking,</a> fishing, hunting, nature study, and wildlife viewing.</p> <p><strong>Established Date:</strong> July 27, 1972<br> <strong>Park Size:</strong> 266,180 hectares    </p>",

This is an unmaintained roadway and there are several areas that are susceptible to overgrowth, flooding and/or washouts. Access is feasible but challenging and a 4x4 vehicle along with strong knowledge of the Willow Creek area is necessary. The official access trails in to Mt Edziza Park are unmaintained, overgrown in sections and do not have bridges over creek crossings. Visitors are asked to use caution when crossing waterways. </blockquote> If you have questions or can provide information about current conditions or hazards within Stikine Area, please contact the BC Parks Stikine Area office, at 250 771-4591. Thank you for your cooperation.</li> </ul> <h4>Special Notes</h4> <ul> <li>Any visitors wishing to fish/angle in BC Parks on the Highway 37 corridor should strongly consider obtaining a <a href=\"http://www.fishing.gov.bc.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">BC Freshwater Fishing Licence</a> while they have access to internet and a printer, there are <strong>very limited</strong> opportunities to obtain a fishing licence on the Highway 37 corridor.</li> <li>Mount Edziza Provincial Park is a magnificent, unspoiled wilderness that needs your help to protect it. Enjoy your visit but be sure to take special care to preserve the park&rsquo;s unique environment so that future visitors may enjoy it as you have.</li> <li>Summer is short at Mount Edziza Provincial Park, where snow lingers year-round on Mount Edziza itself. Although temperatures may hit the 30&deg;C range in mid-summer during the day, it can drop below freezing that same night. Snow and freezing rain are possible any day of the year. Generally, weather suitable for backpacking occurs between July 1 and September 15. Be prepared for adverse weather conditions that can include white-outs and high winds. Be sure to build a weather factor into your trip plans.</li> <li>This is an isolated wilderness area with no supplies of any kind and visitors are very much on their own. Suitable clothing offering protection from wind, cold and rain are essential, as well as equipment for outdoor living. Travellers should be equipped with a compass and topographic maps (see above) for the routes they plan to travel. It should be noted, however, that on the plateau, magnetic properties in the rocks may affect the accuracy of your compass.</li> <li>      High cost to government and putting others in potential danger are two great reasons for you to have a satellite communication device. Satellite communication devices are recommended when backcountry recreating. A communication device will allow you to alert others to an emergency situation or if you are overdue at your destination. This equipment is an essential part of your survival kit, and should be compatible with your activities and location.</li> <li>Snow packs can obscure the trail on the plateau and cause the creeks to rise on warm days. Always use extreme caution when crossing creeks. Hiking or taking shortcuts through the lava fields is not recommended because it is very difficult and potentially unsafe.</li> <li>Bear-proof containers are recommended for the safe storage of food above the tree line on the plateau area. There are bear-proof metal caches available for public use located at Mowdade and Buckley Lakes. Bears frequent the park and can be unpredictable, thus, bear deterrents such as bear spray and or bear bangers should be carried on your person at all times in case an encounter does occur.     </li> </ul> <h4>Stay on the trail</h4> <ul> <li>The volcanic cinder cones on Edziza Plateau are delicate and subject to surface scarring from foot traffic. If you must climb Eve&rsquo;s Cone or other cinder cones, please stay on established routes. A designated route has been established on the north-east ridge of Eve&rsquo;s Cone. <br> </li> </ul> <h4>Aircraft</h4> <ul> <li> Please reference Section    27 (1) and (2) as well as Schedule A of the <a href=\"http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/180_90_01\">Park, Conservancy and    Recreation Area Regulations</a>. </li> <li> Private aircraft are    permitted to land within the park, <strong>with the exception of the lava flows (on the Kitsu Plateau situated    south-southwest of Raspberry Pass) at Mount Edziza Park, from an elevation    of 5,500 feet or higher</strong>.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li><strong>History:</strong> On the east bank of Mess Creek and through Raspberry Pass are the remnants of the Yukon Telegraph line which was constructed to provide a communications link as far north as Dawson City during the Klondike Gold Rush. The telegraph line was in use until 1936 when it was replaced by radio.All that remains are a few poles and collapsed line cabins which once stood every 32 kilometres along the route. The trail is overgrown and no longer passable.</li> <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Prehistorically the area was heavily used by aboriginal peoples, who manufactured obsidian cutting blades and projectile points and traded them throughout northwest America.</li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Along the park&rsquo;s western boundary, Mess Creek flows north to enter the Stikine River three kilometres below the community of Telegraph Creek. Eleven kilometres upstream from this confluence, Mess Creek plunges into a gorge nearly 800 metres deep. To the north of the park boundary, the Stikine River, which means &ldquo;Great River&rdquo; in the language of the Tlingit Indians, has carved a tremendous, Grand Canyon-style passage through eons of volcanic and sedimentary rock deposits. Tree types and vegetation will change with elevations. Telegraph Creek to Buckley Lake area is characterized by a mosaic of shrub fields, wet grasslands and peat meadows. This zone has long, severe winters with deeply frozen soils and short growing seasons. The forests in the lower elevation valleys, Mess Creek and the Kakiddi/Klastline drainage are composed of white spruce as the dominant conifer with an intermixing of lodgepole pine and trembling aspen on the drier sites. On the wetter sites, balsam poplar is also found, in particular, adjacent to creeks, lakes and on delta soils. Between elevations of 900 and 1800 metres, the winters are cold and snowy, the summers are short and warm. The soils in this area are commonly frozen before snowfall.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Moose are probably the most common large animals in the area. Small herds of Osborn caribou may be seen in the  alpine and sub-alpine vegetation zones on the west side of the plateau between Mount Edziza and the western escarpment. Mountain goats and Stone sheep can often be viewed on the south, east and west slopes of Mount Edziza, particularly on the western escarpment and in the Spectrum Range. Visitors may encounter black and grizzly bears. Grizzlies are occasionally seen above timberline where Arctic ground squirrels are abundant. Wolves are sometimes seen or heard. Buckley Lake supports a large waterfowl and shorebird population, which are but a portion of the wide variety of bird species that can be seen in the park. The more conspicuous birds in Mount Edziza include the raven, owl, gyrfalcon, ptarmigan (willow and rock), grouse and migratory songbirds. Typical waterfowl species include goldeneye, grebe, white winged scooter and scaup. <ul> <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>",

The campaign to establish Mount Erskine Provincial Park was supported by many individuals, local businesses, and non-government organizations.</li> <li> <p> <strong>Culture:</strong> Mount Erskine Provincial Park is within the traditional territory of the Chemainus First Nation, Cowichan Tribes, Halalt First Nation, Lake Cowichan First Nation, Lyackson First Nation and Penelakut First Nation (all members of the Hul qumi num Treaty Group) and the Tsawwassen First Nation. The west side of Salt Spring Island from Burgoyne Bay to Vesuvius Bay was part of the traditional summer gathering area for the Cowichan Tribes. There are no recorded archaeological sites in the park. </p> <p> Europeans first settled the area in the mid-1800s. Mount Erskine was named around 1859 by Captain George Richards of the British Royal Navy and labelled as such on British Admiralty Chart 2840, 1861. The name honours Admiral Elphinstone Erskine, who was then Commander-in-Chief of the North American Squadron. Captain Richards named several of the mountains in the area while conducting surveys for the British Admiralty along the west coast of Canada during 1858-1860. </p> <p> Early recorded settlers to this isolated part of Salt Spring Island included many solitary bachelors like Charlie and Albert Toynbee, uncles of well-known islanders Dick, Manson, and Tom Toynbee. Charlie and Albert were thought to have lived in a cabin on the southeast edge of Mount Erskine Provincial Park, not far from the end of present-day Toynbee Road. </p> </li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Mount Erskine Provincial Park supports a unique series of ecosystem types that have very restricted distribution on Salt Spring Island. All but the western-most side of the park is within the Coastal Western Hemlock Biogeoclimatic Zone [CWH] although, in most of this ecosystem, Douglas fir is the dominant tree species. A very small section of the park is in the Coastal Douglas Fir [CDF] and is characterized largely by Douglas fir and western red cedar forests and the occasional grand fir. In addition, the park preserves an excellent example of the red-listed arbutus/hairy manzanita plant community as well as other species and habitats at risk.</li> </ul>",

The mountain for which the park is named guards the park&rsquo;s western entrance. At 3,954 metres, Mount Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies, towers over the lesser surrounding peaks; winter or summer, this is one of the finest&nbsp;views in the Rocky Mountains. Just as the early trappers, hunters and explorers felt in awe at the mountain&rsquo;s magnificence, travellers today experience the same feelings. </p> <p> With Alberta&rsquo;s Jasper National Park as its easterly neighbour, Mount Robson Provincial Park comprises a portion of one of the world&rsquo;s largest blocks of protected areas. Designated as a part of the <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/sites/304.htm\">Canadian Rocky Mountains World Heritage Site</a> by UNESCO in 1990, Mount Robson provides everything from developed, vehicle-accessible camping to remote valleys that seldom see a human footprint. Mount Robson Provincial Park also protects the headwaters of the Fraser River. From its pristine alpine source, the Fraser River gains strength and size to match any of the world&rsquo;s major rivers. Future genations will surely appreciate the protection of this great river&rsquo;s source within Mount Robson Park. </p> <p> Flora and fauna are typical of the western slope of the Rocky Mountains, North Continental Range. One is able, on some trails, to travel between three different vegetation zones during a day hike. Over 182 species of birds have been documented in the park. All wildlife indigenous in the Rocky Mountain can be found here. Mule and Whitetail Deer, Moose, Elk and Black Bear call the lower elevation home while Grizzly Bear, Caribou, Mountain Goat and Mountain Sheep inhabit the higher elevations. With over 217,000 hectares of mostly undisturbed wilderness available, wildlife populations are allowed to ebb and flow with minimal intervention by humans. There are excellent wildlife viewing opportunities throughout the park. From mountain goats on the many cliffs and rockslides to moose in Moose Marsh, the patient observer will be suitably rewarded. </p> <p> First attempted in 1907, it was not until 1913 that humans finally stood on the summit of Mount Robson. On that clear, cold day guide Conrad Kain, W.W. Foster and A.H. McCarthy beheld a view no person had ever seen before. </p> <p> For 20 years, the Mountain Legacy Project (MLP), based today in the School of Environmental Studies at the University of Victoria, has been using repeat photography to examine, analyze, and understand landscape level change in the Canadian mountain west. Mt. Robson Provincial Park, with over 3 kilometres of elevation change from the valley of the Fraser River (approximately 800 m.) to the summit of Mt. Robson (3954 m), and four biogeoclimatic zones, represents a series of interconnected complex mountain ecosystems perfect for landscape level analysis. This park, with an area of roughly 2,250 km², may appear imperishable, but change is evident. Using reference photographs taken in 1911 by Arthur Wheeler, MLP teams went out in the field 100 years later to retake the images from exactly the same locations. All of the historic/modern image pairs so far completed can be seen online at <a href=\"http://explore.mountainlegacy.ca/\">explore.mountainlegacy.ca</a>. A selected group of image pairs were further segmented into land cover classifications and analyzed for change. The results, including some interesting interactive change visualizations, are available at the <a href=\"https://robsonlandscape.weebly.com/\">Visualizing 100 Years of Landscape Change website</a>. This work was completed in part through funding provided through the BC Parks <a href=\"/partnerships/living-labs/\">Living Lab for Climate Change and Conservation Program</a>.      </p>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul><li><p><strong>History:</strong> Established in 1936, the park was named for Frederick Seymour, Governor of British Columbia from 1864 to 1869. Although the first recorded climb of Mount Seymour was made in 1908 by a party from the BC Mountaineering Club, Mount Seymour was virtually unknown to most of the residents of Vancouver and vicinity until the late 1920&amp;rsquo;s. In 1929, members of the Alpine Club of Canada explored the mountain as a potential skiing area and the following year applied for a 21 year lease covering the primary skiing terrain, however the Depression years forced the club to drop the lease. In 1984 the Controlled Recreation Area and its facilities was awarded to Mt. Seymour Resorts Ltd. under a Park Use Permit.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park lies in the coastal western hemlock and mountain hemlock biogeoclimatic zones. Below 1,000 metres, old-growth Douglas-fir and western red cedar are interspersed with second-growth coniferous and deciduous trees and a variety of shrubs. At 1,000 metres and above, forest cover is mostly amabilis fir, yellow cedar and mountain hemlock. Some of the higher meadows are cloaked with sub-alpine flowers, providing colourful early summer displays.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildlife:</strong> A variety of large and small mammals inhabit the park. Coyotes and deer are often seen close to the access road. Black bears, bobcats or cougars may be sighted in the backcountry. It must be strongly emphasized that bears, cougars and bobcats are wild animals and should never be approached, offered food or tormented.</p><p>Among the smaller species and birds to be found in the park are varying hare, Douglas squirrel and pine marten. The Canada jay, identified by its raucous call and social manners, is a frequent visitor to hikers&rsquo; lunching spots. Other indigenous birds include the raven, Steller&rsquo;s jay (the official bird of British Columbia), chickadee, kinglet, sapsucker, grouse and siskin. During their annual fall migration, several species of hawks may be spotted.</p></li></ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> The name Na-di-na Mountain first appeared on the 1879 Geological Survey of Canada map of BC &amp; NWT. Nadina means \"standing up alone\" in the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en language, referring to the prominent, solitary aspect of the mountain.<br>  <br>  This park is one of seven new parks and protected areas resulting from the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and associated government-to-government discussions with the Office of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en. Legislation of the park occurred in July, 2008.</li><li><strong>Culture:</strong> Located within the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en First Nation traditional territory, Nadina Mountain Park is in the Bi Wini house territory, in the house of Keexwinits (House in the Middle of Many) that belongs to the Gitdumden (Bear/Wolf) clan. Naydeena (Nadina) Mountain is a place where Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en people would go to hunt caribou, dutney (groundhog or marmot) and klayyul (mountain goat). Caribou would be snared, with the snare tied to a piece of wood. The wood would be dragged around after the caribou was caught in the snare. When the animal tired of towing the wood or the wood was tangled in trees or rocks it was harvested with spears or arrows.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The conservation role of Nadina Mountain Park is to protect a unique isolated granitic mountain and its associated natural values, including:      <ul> <li>Mountain goats</li> <li>Grizzly bears</li> <li>Lichen communities</li> <li>Granitic spires.</li></ul>Nadina Mountain Park provides important habitat for wildlife that live in and around the park. Mountain goats from Nadina Mountain may disperse to other nearby areas such as Poplar Mountain, Morice Mountain, and Foxy Creek.<br><br>Vegetation below tree line is primarily subalpine fir although rare whitebark pine ecosystems also occur. The expansive alpine tundra has a diverse community of lichen species. Most of the low elevation northwest portion of the park consists of wetland habitat.<br><br>Nadina Mountain Park also provides important ecosystem services (the benefits that people receive from ecosystems) that include clean water, natural flood control, carbon storage, air purification, nutrient cycling, food, biodiversity, recreation, aesthetic experience and spiritual experience.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> A significant population of mountain goats make Nadina Mountain their home. Tufts of goat hair are to be found on rocks along the route to the summit and viewing opportunities are plentiful. Do not approach or attempt to feed the goats, please maintain a respectful distance. Other species commonly observed in the area are black bear, ground squirrels, marmots and deer. Park users should always be aware of bears and other wildlife in our park environment. Never feed or approach bears or other wildlife.</li>      </ul>",

After earthflows occurred depressions were left at the landslide sites. Wetlands developed in areas where the depressions were lower than the permanent water table. These have since developed into a series of raised acidic bogs, formed from the gradual build-up of organic material. The sphagnum peat in the bog is between 2.3 and 4-m thick. This organic bog material has been carbon-dated to determine the timing of the earthflows. The earthflows are thought to have occurred between 1500 and 2650 years ago.<br>      <br>One Provincially Blue-listed vascular plant has been reported in the Nalbeelah Creek Wetlands, the Bog adder&rsquo;s-mouth orchid (Malaxsis paludosa).

Bring your own boat or take the passenger ferry from Nanaimo&mdash;a 10 minute ride that deposits passengers on Newcastle Island, located just a few hundred metres offshore from Vancouver Island. From a distance you&rsquo;ll see an island shoreline dominated by steep sandstone cliffs and ledges, interspersed with sunny beaches &ndash; a marked contrast to the interior of the island, which is studded with mature Douglas fir, Garry oak, arbutus and Big Leaf maple trees.</p><p>Visitors to Newcastle Island can choose from an extensive network of walking/hiking trails that lead to various historic points around the island. Indigenous middens offer mute evidence of at least two Salish villages, which were deserted before the discovery of coal in this area in 1849. Subsequent decades saw the island&rsquo;s fortunes rise and fall as it went through various incarnations while supporting a fish-salting operation, a sandstone quarry and a shipyard.</p><p>In 1931 the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company purchased the island and operated it as a pleasure resort, building a dance pavilion &ndash; now the visitor center &ndash; a teahouse, picnic areas, change houses, a soccer field and a wading pool. An old ship was tied to the dock at Mark Bay and served as a floating hotel. The island became very popular for company picnics and Sunday outings, with ships from Vancouver bringing as many as 1,500 people at a time. The advent of the Second World War, however, caused a decrease in the number of ships available for pleasure excursions and Newcastle Island suffered a consequent decline in popularity.</p><p>Today, park services and facilities include walk-in campsites complete with flush toilets and showers, as well as facilities for group camping and  picnicking. The Pavilion can also be rented for dances, corporate picnics and wedding receptions.</p><p><strong>Established Date:</strong> October 17, 1961<br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 363 hectares (334 hectares of upland and 29 hectares of foreshore)</p><h5>Special Notes</h5><ul><li>A park interpreter is in attendance during the summer to provide visitor information and to interpret the island&rsquo;s unique human and natural history.

For centuries the Salish had occupied this village between the months of September and April, leaving every spring in order to fish for cod and gather clams and tubers on Gabriola Island. Although the Salish were among the island&rsquo;s first coal miners, they were soon &ldquo;supplemented&rdquo; by boatloads of British; these men christened the island after a famous coal town in northern England and diligently worked the mines until 1883. Newcastle Island&rsquo;s supplies of sandstone lasted longer than did the coal: this attractive building material, used in many constructions along the west coast, was quarried from 1869 until 1932.</p><p>Newcastle Island also played a role in the fishing industry of the province. By 1910 the Japanese, who dominated fisheries, had established a small settlement just north of Shaft Point on the west side of the island. Here they operated a saltery and shipyard until 1941 when all the Japanese-Canadians who lived along the coast were sent to internment camps in the Interior in the interests of national security during wartime.</p><p>In 1931, the Canadian Pacific Steamship Company purchased the island and operated it as a pleasure resort, building a dance pavilion (now the visitor centre), teahouse, picnic areas, change-houses, soccer field and a wading pool. An old ship named Charmer (later replaced by the Princess Victoria) was tied to the dock at Mark Bay (Echo Bay) and served as a floating hotel. The island became very popular for company picnics and Sunday outings, with ships from Vancouver bringing as many as 1,500 people at a time. The advent of the Second World War caused a decrease in the number of ships available for pleasure excursions and Newcastle Island suffered a consequent decline in popularity.</p></li><li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Newcastle Island provided a home to the Coast Salish native peoples prior to the discovery of coal in 1849.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Park offers an island shoreline dominated by steep sandstone cliffs and ledges punctuated by beaches and provide a marked contrast to the interior of the island studded with Douglas fir, arbutus, Garry oak and Big Leaf maple trees.</li></ul>",

The park offers visitors a chance to explore many unique and interesting      features of a volcanic landscape and to learn about the culture and legends     of the Nis<u>g</u>a&rsquo;a people.</p>     <p><a href=\"#InterpretivePrograms\">The Nis<u>g</u>a&rsquo;a Visitor Centre offers guided walks     to the volcanic crater</a></p>     <p>Just outside of the park, there are five communities, four of which are      Nis<u>g</u>a&rsquo;a villages. Their names are Gitlakdamix (New Aiyansh), Gitwinksihlkw      (Canyon City), Lakalzap (Greenville), Kincolith and Nass Camp. All communities      are road accessible from the park.

The park is included in the landmark treaty, the &ldquo;Nis<u>g</u>a&rsquo;a      Final Agreement&rdquo;, between the Government of Canada and the Nis<u>g</u>a&rsquo;a      Nation. Nis<u>g</u>a&rsquo;a Memorial Lava Bed Park is also the first provincial     park to be jointly managed by a First Nation and BC Parks.</p>     <p>The Nis<u>g</u>a&rsquo;a alkali basalt flow is one of the youngest and most accessible      volcanic features in British Columbia. The guided volcanic tours offer      the park visitor a chance to hike 3 km through a scenic old growth forest      and past a variety of volcanic features to a viewpoint overlooking the      crater. To protect the special features of the area, unguided access to      the volcanic cone is prohibited. The hike is rated as moderate with some     hills and steep stairs.</p>     <p><strong>Geological History:</strong> As the lava spilled from the crater an estimated 250 years      ago, it followed a creek bed downslope to Lava Lake and down the      Tseax Valley to the Nass River. The lava travelled at different speeds      depending on the steepness of the slope. Some types of lava flow and interesting      features include:</p>     <ul><li>Tree cast &ndash; formed by burned out tree trunks leavingholes in the lava.</li>         <li>Lava tube &ndash; formed as the top layer cooled and          hardened. The crust insulated the lava flowing inside which          eventually flowed out leaving the crust as the roof and walls of          the tube.</li>         <li>Pahoehoe &ndash; lava that often has a smooth surface or is ropey in          form. </li>         <li>AA &ndash; rough and jagged lava.</li>         <li>Blocky &ndash; large chunks of lava.</li></ul><p><strong>Established Date: </strong>April 29, 1992      <br>      <strong>Park Size:</strong> Park &ndash; 17,717 hectares; Protected Areas &ndash; 12 hectares     </p>        <table class=\"hours\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\">         <tr>      <th colspan=\"2\">       Campground Dates of Operation        <div class=\"note\">All dates are subject to change without notice</div>      </th>     </tr>     <tr>      <td width=\"40%\">       <strong>Opening and Closing Campground Dates:</strong><br>       (campground is accessible but may not offer full services such as water, security, etc.)      </td>      <td width=\"60%\">May 9 &ndash; October 16<br>       Off-season: no fee, no services, user maintained </td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>       <strong>Campground Dates with Full Services and Fees:</strong> </td>      <td>May 9 &ndash;October 16<br></td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>       <strong>Campground Reservable Dates:</strong> </td>      <td>Not applicable </td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>       <strong>Total Number of Vehicle Accessible Campsites:</strong></td>      <td>16</td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td>       <strong>Number of Reservable Campsites, if applicable:</strong><br>        (all remaining sites are first-come, first-served)      </td>      <td>Not applicable</td>     </tr>     <tr>      <td colspan=\"2\">       <strong>Note:</strong> The above information is for the campground only.

Legend has it that children had shown disrespect to the life-giving salmon by putting stones and burning sticks into their backs and watching them swim. The elders warned the children repeatedly to stop but they did not listen. Soon the ground began to rumble. The volcano and the lava flow then covered the valley bottom, redirected the mighty Nass River and destroyed two villages.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Northern Rocky Mountains Park provides representation of the Eastern Muskwa Ranges, Muskwa Foothills and Muskwa Plateau ecosections. The park landscape consists of a series of northwest-southeast trending valley and ridges. Glaciation has resulted in broad U-shaped river valley bottoms, mountain cirques and morainal ridges. The mountains in the Muskwa Range have steep eastern faces with gentler grades on western aspects. Peak summit elevations range from Mount Mary Henry at 2641 m to Mount Sylvia at 2942 m. In comparison to the southern Rocky Mountains, the Muskwa Ranges are older and generally show evidence of more complex tectonic deformation that results in spectacular geological features. <p> One of the notable features of the Northern Rocky Mountains Park is the diversity of water features. The area is accentuated by major rivers, clear, cold streams, waterfalls, rapids, small glaciers and lakes. The rivers include the Tetsa, Chischa, Tuchodi and Muskwa and the main creeks are the Gathto, Kluachesi, Dead Dog and Chlotapecta. All creeks and rivers in the Northern Rocky Mountains flow into the Muskwa. Kluachesi and Tetsa are examples of the larger lakes in the area, but the largest and most important water recreation feature in the Northern Rocky Mountains Park is the upper and lower Tuchodi Lakes. </p> <p> The Boreal White and Black Spruce, Spruce Willow Birch and the Alpine Tundra biogeoclimatic zones are found in the Northern Rocky Mountains Park. Forests in the valley bottoms are dominated by white spruce and aspen, and are replaced by sub-alpine fir and white spruce at higher elevations. Alpine plant communities consist of dwarf willows, grasses, sedges, forbs and lichens. The park also has numerous wetlands and native grasslands. Old growth white spruce forests can be found along the major river valley bottoms. </p> </li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> A diverse variety of wildlife inhabits this northeastern mountain landscape. The area provides high quality habitat for moose, elk, stone sheep and mountain goat. The abundance of prey supports predator species such as wolves and grizzly and black bears. Other important wildlife includes furbearers such as marten, fisher, weasels and wolverines. Information on small mammals, amphibians, birds, invertebrates and reptiles is relatively unknown. Lake trout, rainbow trout, bull trout, arctic grayling and lake whitefish are some of the important sport fish species in the Northern Rocky Mountains Park.</li> </ul>",

The park is located within the traditional territory of the Osoyoos Indian Band. <br> <br> sx&#780;&#695;&#601;x&#780;&#695;nitk&#695; park was part of an historic reserve allotment to the Osoyoos Indian Band. The reserve was set aside in 1877 for fishing purposes, but was cut-off in 1913 by the McKenna-McBride Royal Commission to meet settler demands for more land in the region. <br> <br> In the 1950s, the falls that gave sx&#780;&#695;&#601;x&#780;&#695;nitk&#695; park its name were blasted to make way for a flood control dam. <br> <br> The present day park was established on March 16, 1956. In 2015, the Province and Osoyoos Indian Band agreed that the Osoyoos Indian Band will manage sx&#780;&#695;&#601;x&#780;&#695;nitk&#695; park. </li> <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> sx&#780;&#695;&#601;x&#780;&#695;nitk&#695; park has archaeological and cultural heritage significance to the Osoyoos Indian Band and the Okanagan People. There are several archaeological and cultural heritage sites and landforms within the surrounding area that tell an important story about how coyote brought salmon to the Okanagan People. <br> <br> For thousands of years, the Osoyoos Indian Band&rsquo;s Okanagan ancestors used, occupied, lived, camped, traded and fished at sx&#780;&#695;&#601;x&#780;&#695;nitk&#695;. Historically, Chinook, Coho and Sockeye Salmon were fished in abundance at sx&#780;&#695;&#601;x&#780;&#695;nitk&#695;. Today, however, due to extirpated (Coho) and endangered (Chinook) salmon populations, sockeye are the only salmon species fished at sx&#780;&#695;&#601;x&#780;&#695;nitk&#695;. <br> <br> The cultural heritage values in the park include opportunities for the ongoing continuance of Okanagan culture through traditional, ceremonial and cultural use of the area. <br> <br> Please help respect and protect this historically and culturally important area by following the park rules and reporting any suspected archaeological or cultural heritage objects to park staff. Park guests are also reminded that Heritage Conservation Act protects all archaeological and cultural heritage sites in the province. This includes intact or disturbed, known or unknown, recorded or unrecorded sites. </li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> This park conserves riparian vegetation that is important habitat for a variety of bird and bat species including the red listed Pallid bat.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The park offers superb bird watching, with sightings of Western wood peewees, Yellow warblers, Northern orioles and Least flycatchers. There are wildlife viewing, nature study, and photography opportunities here and the park contains habitat for 18 species of bats, one of the highest concentrations in Canada.</li> </ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> Created in 1955, this park shows what effective park planning can achieve. In the late fifties,    thousands of non-native trees were planted on a barren hillside between the highway and the lake. Today, this area is a natural arboretum and the    extensive tree cover is home to various bird types.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Though the campground areas are dotted with irrigated lawn and non-native trees, the park still falls    into two basic zones with bunchgrass found in exposed areas at low elevations and stands of Ponderosa pine and Douglas fir found in the upper    sections. Many wildflowers can be seen along the nature trail away from the more developed areas of the park. Of special note are the Chocolate lily and the Columbian lily.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The close proximity of the highway and the fencing on the uphill side prevent movement of large    mammals such as deer into the campground. Though sightings of large mammals may be infrequent, the park still has a variety of wildlife to see. Harmless gopher snakes and colonies of Columbian ground squirrels can be seen along upland hiking trails. Bats are quite common in areas bordering lakes and may be seen from the park, though they generally prefer areas with less human presence. The Western toad and Western painted turtle have been spotted in the park which also provides habitat for a variety of birds such as Cedar waxwings, quail, Northern shafted flickers, Western meadowlarks, hummingbirds and a blue listed bird species, the Lewis&rsquo;s woodpecker. Insect life is extremely diverse in the park with the Ant Lion being, perhaps, the most interesting. They live buried in conical shaped traps in the sand in ambush for other insects.</li></ul>",

There are archaeological sites and provincially significant First Nations pictographs found on rock outcrops and canyon walls. At one time, the local Salish Indians used Wild Horse Canyon as a wild-horse trap.</p><p>Historic trails form part of the current trail network, some dating back to 1860, when Father Pandosy established an oblate mission near Kelowna. Settlers used a trail through Wild Horse Canyon, but finding the south end of the trail crossed extremely rough and rocky country, Father Pandosy instituted a better trail higher up to the east.</p><p>Good&rsquo;s Creek Canyon Trail was named for Dave Good, supplier of survey crews for the Kettle Valley Railway, built in 1915. Commando Bay was used to secretly train Chinese-Canadians for guerrilla warfare in 1944, during World War II.</p><p>Little remains at the crash site of a DC3 passenger plane that went down in December of 1950 roughly one km northeast of Divide Lake. The two CP Air pilots died in the crash, while 16 others on board were rescued by local search and rescue teams. There is no trail access to the site.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park is a representative example of the Okanagan Basin and Okanagan Highlands. The terrain ranges from the deeply incised melt water channels of Good Creek and Wildhorse Canyon to the 1579m high Okanagan Mountain with spectacular examples of heavily glaciated rock terrain including classic rock drumlins, grooves, flutes and striations.</p><p>The park encompasses ecosystems from three different biogeoclimatic zones: the bunchgrass zone in some of the lower but more exposed areas, the ponderosa pine zone in much of the lower elevations and the interior Douglas fir zone on the upper mountain reaches. Significant old growth Ponderosa pine, Douglas fir, Lodgepole pine and Engelmann spruce covers more than 2500 hectares. The park&rsquo;s plant life represents the influence of both the dry southern and wetter northern climates. The park protects a significant portion of undeveloped lakeshore along Okanagan Lake.</p></li><li><p><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The variety of ecosystems represented in the park leads to an abundance of wildlife that is surprising in an area so close to Kelowna.</p><p>The rugged rocky terrain is habitat for mountain goats. White-tailed deer, moose, elk, lynx, marten, coyote are also found in the park. Small but very important species are the blue listed Western harvest mouse, Nuttall&rsquo;s cottontail (the furthest northerly occurrence) and Spotted bat. The Northern alligator lizard and Western skink can be found under rocks or bark in open wooded areas while the Yellow-bellied racer prefers grasslands and open fields.</p><p>Blue listed reptile species found in the park include Western painted turtle, Rubber boa, Gopher snake, Western blue racer and Western rattlesnake. The park protects habitat for five blue and two red listed bird species including the Western grebe and Whiteheaded woodpecker.</p></li></ul>",

In 2009, actions to remove the dam were initiated because of erosion of the overflow channel. The dam has now been completely removed resulting in lower water levels in the lake chain.<br><br> This park is one of seven new parks and protected areas resulting from the Morice Land and Resource Management Plan (LRMP) and associated government-to-government discussions with the Office of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en. Legislation of the park occurred in July, 2008.<br>     </li><li><strong>Culture:</strong> The park lies in the Tze Zul and Gguzih Keyikh house territories within the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en territory. The Tze Zul house territory is in the house of Ginehklaiyex (House of Many Eyes) that belongs to the Laksilyu (Small Frog) clan. The Gguzih Keyikh house territory is in the house of Kayex (Birchbark House) that belongs to the Gilseyhyu (Big Frog) clan.<br><br>Contributing to the parks cultural significance is the abundance of berry thickets on the south-facing natural grasslands including Saskatoon berries, huckleberries, cranberries and blueberries. The area also has abundant moose, and is known for wild rice (Fritillaria camschatcensis) and wild celery. <br><br>The cultural heritage role for Old Man Lake Park is to provide a connection to place for the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en Nation. Cultural heritage on the land is the essence of the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en identity.<br></li>    <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Old Man Lake Park protects rare wetland ecosystems that offer high value breeding and migratory bird habitat. Red listed Saskatoon Slender wheatgrass grasslands are also protected along with south facing grassland slopes that provide high quality ungulate winter range. Additionally, the park contains a high diversity of berry producing shrubs and food producing plants that are historically important to the Wet&rsquo;suwet&rsquo;en First Nation.<br>    </li>    <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Old Man Lake Park provides important habitat for wildlife that live in and around the park and contains important ungulate winter range. Lower snow depths are important for moose and deer. American Bitterns (blue-listed) have been heard in the Old Man Lake area and are suspected to be breeding in the park. Trumpeter Swans are known to breed in the park and a garter snake winter den has been noted in the park. The area is routinely used as a stopover by migratory birds and contains locally rare breeding populations of Black Tern and Yellow-headed Blackbird. Peregrine Falcons (red-listed) have been observed preying on waterfowl in the Old Man Lake/China Nose area. The cliffs on China Nose Mountain are an ideal nesting location for Peregrine Falcons with good access to prey in Old Man Lake Park. Old Man Lake is eutrophic, and vulnerable to winter kill due to its shallowness and extremely abundant growth of aquatic weeds. Suitable habitat for Rainbow Trout is present.</li>   </ul>",

It was formerly used by First Nations as a base camp for hunting and trapping. The fur trade attracted the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company to the area and their fur brigades used a route which passed through the town. They named it &ldquo;Encampment des Femmes&rdquo; after the women who waited for their men out trapping or on the brigades. (Also known as Otter Flat in later years this spot was officially named Tulameen in 1901 &ndash; an indigenous name referring to deposits of &ldquo;red earth&rdquo; (ochre) found in this area).          </p>  <p>  Gold brought people to the region in the late 1890s and Granite Creek became the third largest city in B.C. rivalling Vancouver and Victoria. Communities sprung up on the strength of the coal and copper mining industry and attracted the Kettle Valley Railway (KVR) and the Granby Mining Company. The region became Canada&rsquo;s sole supplier of platinum and its coal powered the KVR and the VV&amp;E, part of the Great Northern Railway. Today, crumbling building foundations and the empty rail-bed of the KVR winding towards the horizon are echoes of a prosperous past.          </p>  </li>    </ul>",

Mr. Hill laid a hollow cornerstone within which he placed a hammered steel box made from the steel of a captured slave ship. Inside the box, he placed a piece of the Beaver and the Mayflower. The Arch was fitted with two iron gates, leaving them open to symbolize peace between the two great nations. Peace Arch was dedicated in 1921. The lands around the Arch were gathered through donations and fundraising efforts. Two decades later, on November 7, 1939, the Peace Arch and surrounding lands on the Canadian side became Peace Arch Provincial Park.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park features the historical Peace Arch with its engravings &ldquo;Children of a Common Mother,&rdquo; on the Washington side and &ldquo;Brethren Dwelling Together in Unity,&rdquo; on the British Columbia side. Among other things, the park offers broad lawns, public areas, a lily pond and a flower garden in the shape of the Canadian flag.

In May and June of each year, approximately 15,000 to 25,000 wild rainbow trout move up from Pennask Lake to spawn in Pennask Creek. Each year, two million eggs are removed from 10% of the spawning female trout and sent to the Summerland Trout Hatchery to be raised. Once raised, these fish are then used for stocking rainbow trout throughout the province.

The basalt is eroded away, revealing the more resistant ash layer, and often producing vivid bands of color as individual basalt layers are removed.

The search for gold began in 1861, and by 1878 most of the Stikine River drainage had been explored. From 1896 to 1902, Andrew J. Stone conducted expeditions into the Cassiar to collect specimens for the American Museum of Natural History. With his announcements of the discovery of several &ldquo;new&rdquo; species of sheep and caribou, the area became a destination for hunters. Local natives worked as hunting guides and camps were set up throughout the region. Scientists began studying the significant wildlife values in the area in the 1950s and with the efforts of Tommy Walker, Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Park was designated in 1975.<br>      <br>Pitman River Protected Area was designated by the Provincial Government in 2001 following recommendations on the Cassiar Iskut-Stikine Land and Resource Management Plan.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Pitman River lies within the asserted traditional territories of the Tahltan First Nations, Kaska Dena Council and Carrier Sekani Tribal Council.

Three blue-listed species whose habitat is protected in the protected area are the wolverine, the fisher and the grizzly bear. The whole protected area is considered high value habitat for caribou, while significant wetland moose habitat is found along the river, which also provides good quality grizzly  habitat.

Windy and James Bays hold high cultural,                   heritage and fisheries values for the Kitasoo/XaiXais                   First Nation. The Kitasoo people have traditionally                   used Pooley Island for berry picking, collecting                   medicines, and gathering wood for crafts and housing.                   The area is also a traditional hunting and fishing                   area.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong>                  The primary role of the Pooley Conservancy                  is to maintain wolf/deer interactions and habitat                  values. The conservancy maintains watershed integrity                  along with Kermode bear habitat values. The productive                  estuaries at Windy and James Bays are protected within                  the conservancy along with important fisheries values. </li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Often                seen feeding in the scenic estuaries of this conservancy                are black bears and the famous kermode bear who inhabit                the inland. The conservancy is also home to a population                of grey wolves which prey upon the island&rsquo;s deer                population.

Visitors may observe beaver, snowshoe hares,  squirrels and porcupines. Bald eagles and ruffed grouse may be seen in the park and the haunting call of the common loon often breaks the evening  silence.

William Rath, a gold prospector, arrived in 1886 with his young wife and baby daughter. They built a log cabin, cleared the land, and in 1895 they built the barn. William died in 1903, leaving Elizabeth the farm and five children. She proved to be an industrious person, successfully running the farm and eventually operating it as a campground. The suffix &ldquo;trevor&rdquo; was added to give the campground a more lyrical name. Rathtrevor Campground became Rathtrevor Beach Provincial Park in 1967 and though much has changed since William and Elizabeth first arrived, its beauty and importance will be preserved for our continued enjoyment. </li> <li> <strong>Wildlife:</strong> Several species of wildlife can be seen in the park, including deer, raccoons, squirrels, otters, mink, eagles, osprey, hawks, vultures, owls, and many shore and migratory birds that use the park area during their spring and fall migrations.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li><strong>History:</strong> Rolley Lake was named after newlyweds, James and Fanny Rolley who first homesteaded on its shores in 1888 and stayed for 10 years. Since then the area has been the stage for a great deal of activity. In the early 1900s the lake was used as a holding pond for shingle bolts (short logs). A wooden flume sped the bolts 5 km downhill to the Stoltze mill at nearby Ruskin. In the early 1930s, the park area supported a small Japanese-Canadian hand logging operation typical of many that existed throughout the province. If you look closely within the surrounding second growth forest, you may find some of the wooden flumes used to float the bolts, or a plank road of the latter logging days.</li> <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> This area was once used by the Sto:lo of the Coast Salish Nation.</li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The park lies within the wet subzone of the Coastal Western Hemlock biogeoclimatic zone. Typical vegetation in the area includes Douglas-fir, western hemlock, western redcedar, and Pacific silver fir. The west end of Rolley Lake supports a relatively eutrophic fen with sedges, coarse grasses, and other aquatic vegetation.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The park provides habitat for species including Douglas squirrel, blacktail deer, and pileated woodpecker. Rolley Lake is stocked with Coastal Cutthroat trout and rainbow trout.</li> </ul>",

A management      agreement was signed in 1998 between the two parties and stablished a Park Management Board that oversees any issues related      to the management, conservation, recreational and cultural heritage      objectives for the area.     </p>     <p>      <em>Say Nuth Khaw Yum</em> means &ldquo;Serpent&rsquo;s      Land.&rdquo; It is in the core of Tsleil-Waututh traditional territory      that has from time out of mind been an area of significance to the Tsleil-Waututh      people.&nbsp; For over a millenium, the Tsleil-Waututh Nation has continued      to use the land, water and resources of the entire area of Indian Arm.     </p>     <p>      Say Nuth Khaw Yum Provincial Park [aka Indian Arm Park] is a conservation      park that protects the shores of Indian Arm, an 18 kilometre fjord that      extends north from Burrard Inlet in Vancouver. The park area was once      heavily glaciated, leaving behind a spectacular landscape featuring      rugged, forested mountains, several alpine lakes, and numerous creeks      and waterfalls, including the 50-metre high Granite Falls. The park      also includes Racoon and Twin Islands, both characterized by sparse      vegetation, open cover, and exposed rocky ledges.The park offers a variety      of recreation activities.     </p>     <p>Indian Arm is ideal for motor boating, kayaking,      canoeing, and scuba diving. Indian River and the lower reaches of some      creeks are perfect for recreational fishing. The old-growth forested      mountains provide opportunities for hiking, wildlife viewing and nature      appreciation, while the flat beach areas along the shorelines of Bishop      Creek provide opportunities for rustic camping, picnicking and other      day-use activities. Marine access camping is also available on the south      side of Granite Falls. The shoals around Racoon and Twin Islands offer      good scuba diving. Visitors can also enjoy limited, rustic camping on      North / Big Twin Island. Please note that there is no camping      on South/Little Twin Island.     </p>     <h4>     Special Features      </h4>     <p>      There      are two waterfalls within the park &ndash; Granite Falls and Silver Falls.      The Indian River estuary protects important wildlife habitat. There      is also a tidal lagoon between North and South Twin Islands. Black bear      sightings are common along the shoreline. A large run of pink salmon      (60,000 fish) make their way up the arm on odd numbered years. They      can be seen jumping all along the shoreline. The fish concentrate in      the Indian River estuary and then work their way up the Indian River.      The Chum Salmon make their way up the arm annually in large numbers.      Smaller numbers of Coho and Chinook salmon find their way back to the      Indian River each year. With the concentration of salmon in the fall,      large numbers of eagle can be viewed overhead, and amongst the salmon      there are many seals feeding.     </p>     <p>      This park also contains      a number of significant archaeological sites. All archaeological      sites are protected under the Heritage Conservation Act.&nbsp; It is      illegal to remove artifacts or to disturb such sites.     </p>     <p>      <strong>Date Established:</strong> July 13, 1995      <br>      <strong> Size:</strong> 6,689 hectares      </p>",

In the 1930&rsquo;s, the area was used as a relief camp for the workers building Highway 99. In 1976 the area was purchased by Carling O&rsquo;Keefe Brewery, who used the pure mountain water to brew their beer, and made the area a logging show park. In 1982 O&rsquo;Keefe donated the land to BC Parks. Throughout the park area there is evidence of logging activity that occurred here roughly 90 years ago. A number of excellent spring board notches on old stumps are scattered throughout the forested area and much of the deadfall also exhibits evidence of the logging techniques of this period.</li><li><strong>Culture:</strong> This park holds significant spiritual value to the Squamish First Nation, the first people to live in this area. They told of a two headed sea serpent, Say-noth-ka who lived in and around Howe Sound. According to legend this beast travelled both on land and in water. Some versions say it was Say-noth-ka who formed Shannon Falls by slithering and twisting his powerful body up the mountainside on repeated expeditions, Say-noth-ka gradually wore down a spillway for those cascading waters.</li></ul>",

The lush green lawns of Skihist have always invited travellers to stop and relax from the heat of the summer. The park preserves a section of the historic Cariboo Wagon road. The starting point of the road was in Yale and construction of the road took place between 1862 and 1865. The road was a narrow, treacherous track winding along the cliffs of the canyon and allowed stagecoaches and freight wagons access to the BC interior. The road linked the gold fields of the Cariboo to Vancouver.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> BC Parks uses prescribed burns as a conservation tool. The intense build-up of Ponderosa pine needles on the forest floor in Skihist park could contribute to a catastrophic fire, should one occur. The needles also change the PH balance of the soil, restricting growth of grasses and plants. Prescribed burns are used in the campground to eliminate the needle build-up and provide opportunities for new growth.<p>Which plants can you identify?

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul><li><strong>History:</strong> The park was established on December 3, 1975. Named for the region of the province that it occupies, Spatsizi means &ldquo;red goat&rdquo; in the Tahltan First Nation language. It was a name given to the mountain goats of the area because of their habit of rolling in the iron oxide-coloured dust, which changed their normally white coats to red.<br><br>Historically, Spatsizi was the hunting ground of the Tahltan First Nation. It was seldom visited by outsiders prior to 1926, when the  Hyland brothers established a post on the Spatsizi River to trade with native fur trappers. In 1948, Tommy Walker set up permanent hunting and fishing camps  at Hyland Post and Cold Fish Lake, hiring local Caribou Hide Indians as guides. It was largely due to the efforts of Walker that the park and Gladys Lake  Ecological Reserve were created in 1975.</li><li><strong>Conservation:</strong> This park spreads across two broad physiographic regions, the Spatsizi Plateau and the Skeena Mountains. The plateau, a rolling upland, ranges in elevation from 1,600 to 2,000 metres, and extends in a broad curve broken by wide &ldquo;u&rdquo; shaped valleys. The Eaglenest Range of the Skeena Mountains&nbsp;dominates the northwest. Its highest peak, Mt. Will (2,500 metres) towers above Gladys Lake.<br><br>A portion of the central part of the park just south of Cold Fish Lake has been designated as the Gladys Lake Ecological Reserve. The reserve was created for the study of stone sheep and mountain goats in an undisturbed habitat. Persons wishing to view these animals may hike the reserve.</li><li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Lands within the park have an excellent capability for supporting large populations of wildlife. The light  snow depths in the rain shadow of the Eaglenest Range create one of the most important habitats for woodland caribou in British Columbia. The Spatsizi River  Valley, with its many flooded areas and oxbow ponds, provides aquatic vegetation for summer forage as well as willow flats for winter browse for moose. Grizzly  and black bears, wolverines, beaver, hoary marmot, and Arctic ground squirrels are fairly abundant and more than 140 species of birds including gyrfalcons,  Smith&rsquo;s longspurs and American Golden Plovers have been recorded within the park boundaries.</li></ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li><strong>History:</strong> Europeans first visited the area of the Stikine Country Protected Areas in 1824 and in the following year, the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company and the Russian American Company claimed areas for trapping. The search for gold began in 1861, and by 1878 most of the Stikine River drainage had been explored. From 1896 to 1902, Andrew J. Stone conducted expeditions into the Cassiar to collect specimens for the American Museum of Natural History. With his announcements of the discovery of several &ldquo;new&rdquo; species of sheep and caribou, the area became a destination for hunters. Local natives worked as hunting guides and camps were set up throughout the region. Scientists began studying the significant wildlife values in the area in the 1950s and with the efforts of Tommy Walker, Spatsizi Plateau Wilderness Park was designated in 1975.<br> <br>The BCR railgrade that passes within 3km of the park was extended in the 1970&rsquo;s to promote trade and resource development in the Cassiar region. The railway was not completed but the grade and a bridge across the Stikine were constructed and are used today by hikers, hunters and horseback    riders.<br> <br>Spatsizi Headwaters Park was designated by the Provincial Government in 2001 following recommendations on the Cassiar Iskut-Stikine Land and Resource Management Plan.</li> <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Spatsizi Headwaters Park lies within the asserted traditional territories of the Tahltan First Nations and Carrier Sekani Tribal Council.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> The park was established on November 22, 1995, following a 25 year debate over development versus protection. The name comes from the Nlaka&rsquo;pamux word &ldquo;Stagyn,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;hidden place,&rdquo; referring to the fact that the valley and the extent of the watershed is not very noticeable from the Stein River&rsquo;s mouth on the Fraser River. The valley has been extremely important to the Nlaka&rsquo;pamux people for thousands of years, both spiritually and for sustenance. Since the establishment of the park the Stein is managed via the Stein Valley Co-Operative Management Agreement between the Lytton First Nation and the Province of BC &ndash; on the Stein Management Board. The function of the Management Board is to oversee and provide management direction for all initiatives and undertakings related to the planning, operation and management of the Park. This arrangement also provides the park with two seasonal full-time Wardens who assist both the users of the park as well as maintaining values within the park particularly in the lower Stein. Please ensure all your activities within the park are respectful and you practice a &ldquo;leave no trace&rdquo; philosophy.</li>       <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Stein Valley straddles the transition from the dry interior to the wetter Coastal Mountains. This, combined with the large elevational gradient, has resulted in very diverse vegetation communities within the park. Dry ponderosa pine forests characterize the lower valley, while Douglas fir is predominant in the mid-valley and hemlock, cedar, spruce and fir become predominant in the western end of the valley. Patches of cedar exist throughout the valley, even at the eastern end in moist, cool locations along creeks such as Stryen and Teaspoon. Floodplain forests along the river are dominated by black cottonwood mixed with aspen and birch. Higher elevations are noted for stands of Engelmann spruce and subalpine fir, and above those are white bark pine and alpine tundra. Spectacular flower blooms occur in the spring and summer, particularly at higher elevations.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Due to its size and relative lack of disturbance, the park contains populations of many species of wildlife that indicate its relative health as wilderness. It is thought to contain over 50 species of mammals, including mountain goat, cougar, wolverine, black bear and grizzly bear. Bird species include golden eagles, sharp shinned hawks, barred owls, pigmy owls, white-tailed ptarmigan, pileated woodpeckers and rufous hummingbirds, as well as several species of chickadees, warblers and nuthatches. The Stein River contains dolly varden char, rainbow trout and Rocky Mountain whitefish, as well as steelhead trout, coho, pink and chinook salmon that return to the river at certain times of the year to spawn.</li>    </ul>",

Located almost in the centre of Vancouver Island, Strathcona park is a rugged mountain wilderness comprising more than 250,000 hectares. Mountain peaks &ndash; some perpetually mantled with snow &ndash; dominate the park. Lakes and alpine tarns dot a landscape laced with rivers, creeks and streams. Summer in Strathcona is usually pleasantly warm, while winters are fairly mild except for the higher levels, where heavy snowfalls are the norm. From November through March, snowfalls can be expected on the mountain slopes and alpine plateaus. Snow remains all year on the mountain peaks and may linger into July even at moderate elevations. Summer evenings, as elsewhere in the coastal regions of B.C., can be cool and rain can be expected at any time of the year.</p><p>Two areas &ndash; Buttle Lake and vicinity, and Forbidden Plateau &ndash; offer a variety of visitor-oriented developments. The rest of the park is largely undeveloped and appeals primarily to people seeking wilderness surroundings. To see and enjoy much of the scenic splendor requires hiking or backpacking into the alpine regions.</p><p>Buttle Lake, named for Commander John Buttle who explored the area in the 1860s, is the major body of water in the park. It and many other lakes and waterways in the park can provide good fishing in season for Cutthroat, Rainbow and Dolly Varden trout. Della Falls, whose drop of 440 metres over three cascades makes it one of the highest waterfalls in Canada, is located in the southern remote section of the park with the trailhead only accessible by boat at the northwest end of Great Central Lake. And the highest point on Vancouver Island, the Golden Hinde (elevation 2,200 metres), stands almost in the centre of Strathcona to the west of Buttle Lake.</p><p>Three roadless tracts within Strathcon Provincial Park &ndash; Big Den, Central Strathcona and Comox Glacier--have been designated as nature conservancy areas. Each tract contains outstanding examples of scenery and natural history that remain uninfluenced by human activity. The three areas, totalling 122,500 hectares, are dedicated to the preservation of the undisturbed natural environment.</p><p>While the high mountain peaks and deep shaded valleys of Strathcona Park are dramatic, it is easy to forget that beneath your feet lays a history stretching back 380 million years. It is a history of violent volcanic eruptions on ancient seafloors and quiet interludes when gardens of sea lilies waved in gentle ocean currents. It is a history of rocks torn and folded by the extraordinary forces that can move continents, and of mountain ranges sculpted by the immensely thick ice sheets, which only vanished a few thousand years ago. No matter how long your visit, or whatever your interest, a knowledge of the <a href=\"http://www.empr.gov.bc.ca/MINING/GEOSCIENCE/PUBLICATIONSCATALOGUE/INFORMATIONCIRCULARS/IC1995-07/Pages/GeologicalHistory.aspx\">geology of Strathcona Park</a> will enhance your enjoyment of this spectacularly beautiful area.</p><p>Strathcona Park benefits from excellent adjoining commercial facilities such as the Strathcona Park Lodge and Outdoor Education Centre, which offers outdoor education and wilderness skills training. The nearby communities of Campbell River, the Comox Valley, Gold River, Tofino and Port Alberni offer a full range of visitor services. Mount Washington Alpine Resort, located adjacent to the park, offers extensive alpine and nordic skiing opportunities, as well as a variety of winter and summer recreation facilities.</p><p>The <a href=\"/explore/parkpgs/strath_mt/\">Megin-Talbot addition</a> in Strathcona Provincial Park was identified for protection in the Clayoquot Sound Land-Use  Decision in 1995.</p><p><strong>Date Established:</strong> March 1, 1911 <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 248,669 hectares (247,961 hectares of upland and 708 hectares of foreshore)</p>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul><li><p><strong>History:</strong> Strathcona Park, designated in 1911, is the oldest provincial park in British Columbia. In the valleys and lower regions of Strathcona are forest stands that were already old when Captain James Cook of Britain&rsquo;s Royal Navy landed at Nootka Sound in 1778, on the west coast of Vancouver Island a few kilometres from what is now the western boundary of the park.</p><p>Strathcona Park was named for Donald Alexander Smith, First Baron Strathcona and Mount Royal, a Canadian pioneer and one of the principals in the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway. On November 7, 1885 Lord Strathcona drove the last iron spike into the twin ribbons of steel that united Canada from the Atlantic to the Pacific at Craigellachie in BC&rsquo;s Selkirk Mountains.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conservation:</strong> Western red cedar, Douglas fir, grand fir, amabilis fir and western hemlock cover much of the park&rsquo;s valleys and lower mountain slopes; this gives way to sub-alpine fir, mountain hemlock and creeping juniper in the sub-alpine areas. Throughout the summer months the park offers a spectacular floral display in various areas from sea level to above 1,800 metres elevation.

Species such as the Roosevelt elk, the currently-endangered Vancouver Island marmot, the Vancouver Island wolf, and the coastal black-tailed deer are different from their mainland relatives. The park has a large deer population and a significant number of Roosevelt elk while wolves and cougars, though present, are seldom seen. Resident birds include the chestnut-backed chickadee, red-breasted nuthatch, winter wren and kinglet, as well as the gray jay, Steller&rsquo;s jay and band-tailed pigeon. The park also supports numerous blue grouse, ruffled grouse and a limited number of unique Vancouver Island white-tailed ptarmigan.</p><ul><li><a href=\"docs/strathcona-marmots.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Poster: Reintroducing Vancouver Island Marmots to Strathcona Provincial Park <span class=\"fileinfo\">[PDF]</span></a></li></ul></li></ul>",

			"description": "<img src=\"stuart_marine.jpg\" alt=\"Stuart Lake Marine Provincial Park\" width=\"300\" height=\"197\" class=\"park_photo\"> The Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lake boating system is located in north central British Columbia and comprises nearly 300 km of waterway. These long, narrow  lakes are among the region&rsquo;s most significant recreational features. The lakes offer great sports fishing opportunities for rainbow and lake trout, burbot,  kokanee, and mountain whitefish. The chain is also part of the longest migration route of chinook and sockeye salmon in British Columbia. With more than 630 km  of lakeshore to explore, few developed facilities, and sparse levels of use, this chain of lakes provides a remote wilderness experience. A series of small  parks have been established along the system providing protected anchorages or attractive beaches. No facilities have been developed at these sites.<br> <br> Stuart Lake is one of the largest natural lakes in the province at 90 km long with 270 km of shoreline. The community of Fort St. James is located on the southeast end. The main body of the lake is between 6 to 10 km wide and is road accessible at many locations. The northwestern arm of the lake is narrower, has limited road access, and more of a wilderness feel. This portion of the lake is very scenic with numerous bays, points, and islands. Wildlife  viewing, boating, hunting, and angling are popular pursuits in the area.<br> <br> Stuart Lake Marine Park consists of three lakeside sites protected as part of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lakes boating system. Stuart Lake Park is also on the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lakes boating system. These sites provide no facilities, but may offer protected anchorages or sandy beaches.<br> <br> The  Tachie River connects Stuart Lake to Trembleur Lake. The 26 km of river can be a challenge to navigate with fast water and small rapids. Trembleur Lake is almost 50 km long. It has an irregular shoreline with sheltered bays and coves and a scenic wilderness setting. There is one marine park site on Trembleur  Lake.<br> <br> The Middle River flows from Takla Lake into Trembleur Lake. The river, designated as a Provincial Heritage River, is 22 km long and navigable.  At 96 km in length, Takla is the fifth largest lake in the province. Almost 250 km of undisturbed shoreline with sandy beaches and isolated bays are available  to explore. There are three marine park sites on Takla Lake.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li><strong>History:</strong> For many years prior to the arrival of European explorers, the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area was home to the Dakelh-ne people. In 1806, Simon Fraser brought the fur trade to this area with the establishment of the Stuart Lake Post for the North West Company.<br> <br> The company merged with the  Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company in 1821, and in 1822 they named the settlement Fort St. James. Fort St. James, once the economic capital of the colony of New Caledonia, saw its importance as a fur trading centre diminish in 1869 when gold was discovered 100 miles north in the Omineca Valley.<br> <br>With the miners came a new economic prosperity for the area that has largely been replaced by the forest industry today. Tourism is also growing, and hunting and fishing lodges can be found on all three lakes.</li> <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Although settled by Europeans almost 200 years ago, the Dakelh-ne people had inhabited the area for years prior. To the fur traders, these people became known as the Carrier people, referring to the custom of widows who carried the ashes of cremated husbands with them until a traditional potlatch could be held.<br> <br> The Carrier people traditionally led a semi-nomadic life, congregating along lakes and rivers in the warmer months to pick berries, hunt and tan hides, and catch and process the salmon that was an important staple of their diet. The winter was spent ice fishing and trapping in smaller family units.<br> <br> Several Carrier groups reside in the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area including the Nak&rsquo;azdli, Yekoochet&rsquo;en, Takla, and Tl&rsquo;azt&rsquo;en. Traditional trails, culturally altered trees, and pictographs can be found throughout the area.</li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The three small sites of Stuart Lake Marine Park and Stuart Lake Park protect natural areas and contribute to the role of the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes system as a backcountry boating destination area.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Diversity of the terrain and types of vegetation support abundant wildlife populations. Moose and black bear are plentiful. Other more secretive species include mule and white-tail deer, wolf, and grizzly bear. Furbearers in the area include lynx, fox, beaver, marten,  fisher, otter, and wolverine.</li> </ul>",

These long, narrow lakes are among the region&rsquo;s most significant recreational features.<br>     <br>The lakes offer great sports fishing opportunities for rainbow and lake trout, burbot, kokanee, and mountain whitefish. The chain is also part of the longest migration route of chinook and sockeye salmon in British Columbia. With more than 630 km of lakeshore to explore, few developed facilities, and sparse levels of use, this chain of lakes provides a remote wilderness experience.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>      <li><strong>History:</strong> For many years prior to the arrival of European explorers, the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area was home to the Dakelh-ne people. In 1806 Simon Fraser brought the fur trade to the area with the establishment of the Stuart Lake Post for the North West Company.<br>     <br>The company merged with the Hudson&rsquo;s Bay Company in 1821, and in 1822 they named the settlement Fort St. James. Fort St. James, once the economic capital of the colony of New Caledonia and said to be the oldest European-settled community in British Columbia, saw its importance as a fur trading centre diminish in 1869 when gold was discovered 100 miles north in the Omineca Valley. With the miners came a new economic prosperity for the area that has largely been replaced by the forest industry today. Tourism is also growing, and hunting and fishing lodges can be found on all three lakes.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Although settled by Europeans almost 200 years ago, the Dakelh-ne people had inhabited the area for years prior. To the fur traders, these people became known as the Carrier people, referring to the custom of widows who carried the ashes of cremated husbands with them until a traditional potlach could be held.<br>      <br>The Carrier people traditionally led a semi-nomadic life, congregating along lakes and rivers in the warmer months to pick berries, hunt and tan hides, and catch and process the salmon that was an important staple of their diet. The winter was spent ice fishing and trapping in smaller family units.<br>     <br>     Several Carrier groups reside in the Stuart-Trembleur-Takla lakes area including the Nak&rsquo;azdli, Yekoochet&rsquo;en, Takla, and Tl&rsquo;azt&rsquo;en. Traditional trails, culturally altered trees, and pictographs can be found throughout the area.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The three small sites of Takla Lake Marine Park protect natural areas and contribute to the role of the Stuart &ndash; Trembleur &ndash; Takla lakes system as a backcountry boating destination area.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Diversity of the terrain and types of vegetation support abundant wildlife populations. Moose and black bear are plentiful. Other less visible species include mule and white-tail deer, wolf, and grizzly bear. Furbearers in the area include the lynx, fox, beaver, marten, fisher, otter, and wolverine.</li>     </ul>",

Tatshenshini-Alsek Park contains nearly one million hectares of glacier-cloaked peaks, wild rivers, grizzly bears and unusual plant  communities. Situated in the very northwest corner of British Columbia, it nestles between Kluane National Park and Reserves in the Yukon and Glacier Bay  &amp; Wrangell-St. Elias National Parks and Preserves in Alaska. Combined, these parks comprise the largest protected area in the world, approximately 8.5  million hectares. The Tatshenshini-Alsek Park has been designated as a <a href=\"http://whc.unesco.org/sites/72.htm\" target=\"_blank\">World Heritage Site</a> by UNESCO. The  Alsek and Tatshenshini rivers are responsible for much of what&rsquo;s special in the area. The great gap they&rsquo;ve carved through the coastal mountains allows cool, moist ocean air into the cold interior. The quick change from ocean to interior environment, frequent floods, landslides and avalanches, a varied geology and great elevation changes have together created an exceptionally diverse range of habitat conditions.</p>    <p>     Despite its remote location the ruggedly beautiful Tatshenshini-Alsek region is attracting an increasing number of recreationalists: <a href=\"rafting_kayaking.html\" target=\"_blank\">kayakers and rafters</a> are drawn to the two magnificent river systems; <a href=\"hiking_biking.html\" target=\"_blank\">hikers</a> and mountaineers confront a near-endless pristine wilderness that includes everything from alpine  meadows to the jagged edges of the Alsek Ranges and Mt. Fairweather, the province&rsquo;s highest peak at 4,633 metres; and <a href=\"hiking_biking.html\" target=\"_blank\">mountain bikers</a> can explore old mining roads and other interesting and challenging terrain. Interestingly, the Haines Highway provides an opportunity to see much of the same unusual plant and animal diversity that river users experience.</p>    <p><strong>Established Date:</strong> October 15, 1993     <br>     <strong>Park Size:</strong> 947,026 hectares<br>    </p>",
			"purpose": "",
			"safetyInfo": "<h4>Stay Safe</h4>    <ul>     <li>Visitors to Tatshenshini-Alsek Park should be aware that this is a rugged wilderness area; appropriate clothing, camping gear and sufficient supplies are a necessity. If planning to hike or mountain bike, it is important to remember that weather conditions in the summer are highly variable. Although a day may start with clear skies and sunshine, it can quickly change, and snow is possible any day of the year. High winds are frequent and there are often long spells of cold, wet weather.    </li>     <li>Rafters must be aware that the remoteness of this park is an <strong>essential</strong> factor to consider in trip preparation and safety. The exception to the level of difficulty is Turnback Canyon on the Alsek River. This section of the river is <strong>extremely hazardous at all water levels </strong>and travel is <strong>not recommended</strong> for even the most skilled rafter/kayaker. <strong>Portaging is recommended for all trips. </strong>      <p>   </li>    </ul>    <h4>Special Notes<br>     </h4><ul><li>Comprehensive archaeological studies of the Alsek and Tatshenshini River corridors are not yet complete. If you come across a site or artifact of cultural significance you are encouraged to report its location and what you saw to the BC Parks office in Atlin at (250) 651-7634. Please remember that it is an offence to damage or remove any natural or cultural resource from a Provincial Park.</li>   <li>Despite the great diversity of life found in the Tatshenshini, existence for its inhabitants can be a fragile one. Winters are long, the growing season is short and damaged vegetation rehabilitates slowly. This is one reason why <strong>no motorized vehicles are allowed off the highway</strong>, except in the winter when snowmobiling is <strong> allowed within a specified area.</strong> Visitors are asked to take special care to minimize impact on the landscape. Please pack out your litter and plan any camping or campfires so there is no evidence of your passage. This will ensure that future travelers will experience the same wilderness that you do.</li></ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>      <li><strong>History:</strong> Ten Mile Lake Park was established in 1962 as a recreational destination for residents of Quesnel, as well as travellers on the Cariboo Highway. The name of the park comes from the milepost on the Pacific Great Eastern Railway that stood here in the early 1900s. There is still evidence of the abandoned rail grade in the park; the tracks had to be relocated because of difficulties in crossing the Cottonwood River north of the park.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> The city of Quesnel was established as a supply centre during the Cariboo Gold Rush of the 1860s. It was originally much smaller than nearby Barkerville, which is now preserved as a <a href=\"http://www.barkerville.ca\" target=\"_blank\">Historic Town</a>. </li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Ten Mile Lake Provincial Park is situated within the Fraser Basin, an irregular shaped depression of gently rolling hills and shallow lakes covering much of North Central B.C. The park lies in a transition area between the wetter Quesnel Highlands to the east, and the dry Chilcotin Plateau to the west, leading to a wide diversity of plant species. You can find white spruce, Douglas-fir, trembling aspen and lodgepole pine, while the forest floor is home to shrubs like red osier dogwood and saskatoon. Flowers, trees and shrubs are part of the park&rsquo;s natural heritage, please don&rsquo;t damage or remove them.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Walk the Beaver Pond trail and view a beaver lodge and series of beaver dams.

With the European demand for fur, trappers moved into the area during the early 1800&rsquo;s. Since that time the popularity of the area has increased with hunting, fishing, and recreational boating avidly pursued. The significance of the hot springs first prompted the area to be set aside as a recreation reserve. The hot springs were then proposed as an ecological reserve in 1974. Site surveys were undertaken by B.C. Hydro in the early 1980s as part of the Liard River investigations. The Fort Nelson Land and Resource Management Plan recommended the area in 1997 as a Protected Area due to the regionally significant hot springs for wildlife, viewing, hiking and First Nations values.

The three main hot springs originate in the middle of an extensive muddy area. The lower river bars around the springs are covered by shrubby vegetation such as glaucous-leaved honeysuckle, common snowberry, western choke cherry and    silverberry. The higher terrace hosts alluvial poplar forests with luxurious herb layers that are mainly the result of nutrient enrichment caused by animals visiting the mineral lick. These hot springs are an important mineral lick used by moose and other ungulates.</li>       <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> A diverse variety of wildlife species utilize the area.

During pre-colonial times, visitors came from as far away as the interior of British Columbia, Montana and Alberta to obtain chert, a grey, translucent, obsidian-like rock that was mined at Top of the World Park and traded as well as worked into tools and weapons. <strong>Removal of archeological artifacts within the park is prohibited.</strong></li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> At mid elevations, the forests in Top of the World Park consist primarily of old growth balsam and Douglas fir and Engelmann spruce with some lodgepole pine below 1,700 metres in the Lussier Creek drainage. Sitka alder is common in the lower reaches of the Summer Creek drainage and is found along the Lussier River and around Fish Lake. Near the timber line, alpine larch and white bark pine are interspersed with fir and spruce.<br> <br>Alpine flowers carpet much of the plateau in July and early August, with glacier lilies, mountain forget-me-nots and western anemone being the most abundant. At lower elevations, there are globe-flowers, Indian paintbrush, broad leafed arnica, bunchberries and yellow columbines adding their vivid splashes of colour.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> The park is home to several species of large mammals, occasional sightings are made of moose, elk, white-tailed deer, wolverine, bear and porcupine in the Lussier River and Coyote Creek watersheds. Mule deer frequent the alpine meadows and marmots are found at higher elevations. Rocky Mountain bighorn sheep may be seen in the vicinity of Mount Doolan and near Mount Morro, and mountain goats are seen on the ridges that form the western boundary of the park.<br> <br>Birdlife is abundant around Fish Lake. Clark&rsquo;s nutcrackers, Steller&rsquo;s jays, grey jays, varied thrushes and pine grosbeaks inhabit the lake area throughout the summer. Scaups, buffleheads and other waterfowl, including loons, often rest upon the lake; bald eagles and ospreys are seen in the spring when the fish are spawning. Fish Lake, the largest body of water in the park, is noted for its cutthroat trout and Dolly Varden fishery.</li> </ul>",

The site provides no facilities but offers a protected anchorage     and sandy beach. Trembleur Lake is almost 50 kilometres long. It has an     irregular shoreline with sheltered bays and coves, and a scenic wilderness     setting. Wildlife viewing, boating, hunting, and angling are popular pursuits     in the area.<br>   <br>The west end of Trembleur Lake is protected as part of the 41,233 hectare      Rubyrock Lake Park.<br>     <br>The Stuart-Trembleur-Takla Lake boating system is located in north central     British Columbia and comprises nearly 300 kilometres of waterway. These     long, narrow lakes are among the region&rsquo;s most significant recreational     features. The lakes offer great sports fishing opportunities for rainbow     and lake trout, burbot, kokanee, and mountain whitefish. The chain is also     part of the longest migration route of chinook and sockeye salmon in British     Columbia. With more than 630 kilometres of lakeshore to explore, few developed     facilities, and sparse levels of use, this chain of lakes provides a remote     wilderness experience. <br>     <br>A series of small parks have been established along the system providing     protected anchorages or attractive beaches. No facilities have been developed     at these sites. <br>     <br>Stuart Lake, one of the largest lakes in the province at 90 kilometres     long, is the southernmost lake of the chain. The community of Fort St. James     is located on the southeast end of the lake. The main body of the lake is     between 6 to 10 kilometres wide and is road accessible at many locations.     The northwest arm of the lake is narrower, has limited road access, and     more of a wilderness feel. This portion of the lake is very scenic with     numerous bays, points, and islands. There are four marine park sites on     Stuart Lake and two provincial campgrounds. <br>     <br>The Tachie River connects Stuart Lake to Trembleur Lake. The 26 kilometres     of river can be a challenge to navigate with fast water and small rapids.     Trembleur Lake is almost 50 kilometres long. It has an irregular shoreline     with sheltered bays and coves, and a scenic wilderness setting. There is     one marine park site on Trembleur Lake. <br>     <br>The Middle River flows from Takla Lake into Trembleur Lake. The river,     designated as a Provincial Heritage River, is 22 kilometres long and navigable.     At 96 kilometres in length, Takla is the fifth largest lake in the province.     Almost 250 kilometres of undisturbed shoreline with sandy beaches and isolated     bays are available to explore. There are three marine park sites on Takla     Lake. There is sporadic road access on the east side of the lake. <br>     NTS map references:<ul><li>Stuart Lake &ndash; 93K/7, 93K/8, 93K/9, 93K/10, 93K/11</li><li> Tachie River &ndash; 93K/10 &amp; 93K/15</li><li> Trembleur Lake &ndash; 93K14 &amp; 93K/15</li><li> Middle River &ndash; 93K/14</li><li> Takla Lake &ndash; 93M/1, 93M/8, 93M/9, 93N/3, 93N/4, 93N/5</li></ul>",

It is bordered by the rugged peaks of the Coast Mountains to the west, and the dry Interior Plateau to the east. The diversity and contrast in landscapes and vegetation are a result of a rainshadow effect on the east side of the mountains. While the northern and eastern portions of the park are relatively dry, the south end of Chilko Lake is characterized by moist areas of the coastal western hemlock zone.</p><p>The provincial park was established in February of 1994 as a wilderness area set aside to protect vegetation, wildlife and fish habitats, cultural values, and special features. The diverse ecosystems in the park remain largely undisturbed by human activity, making this park an ecologically significant area in the province. Chilko Lake, the largest, natural high-elevation freshwater lake in Canada, dominates the park. Stunningly beautiful, due to its blue-green hues and dramatic mountain backdrops, Chilko Lake is popular with boaters, kayakers, and anglers. Backcountry hiking and camping is also a cornerstone of the recreational opportunities offered by this remote park.</p><p><strong>Established Date:</strong> February 12, 1994 <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 233,240 hectares</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> Ts&rsquo;il&#660;os Park is co-managed through a Memorandum of Understanding between BC Parks and the Xeni Gwet&rsquo;in First Nations Government.</p>",

This resort provided cabins, camping and boat launch facilities and was very popular with Prince George and Mackenzie residents. In 1974, BC Hydro purchased this property, located within the reservoir basin, because of the possible effect of the Williston Reservoir at maximum full pool flooding. Public demand for maintaining recreational opportunities of this area was so strong that BC Hydro contracted a caretaker to maintain the campground, picnic area and boat launch. During this time public pressure for park development at this site grew and following considerable negotiations, a Provincial Park was established in August, 1981. </li>       <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> There are no known archaeological sites within the vicinity of Tudyah Lake Park. However, it is likely that the area was used by the Sekani Indians for hunting and fishing, with the waterways being used as travel and trade routes.</li>       <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Within the developed areas of the park, opportunities for viewing wildlife are limited. However, in the natural setting along the Pack River, wildlife such as beaver, otter, muskrat, moose, waterfowl and upland birds may be commonly observed. Although less conspicuous other animals expected to inhabit the area include deer, black bear, moose, wolves, coyotes and fox. <br>        <br>Tudyah Lake supports a moderate to highly productive fishery with Rainbow trout and Dolly Varden as the popular sport species. Bear Creek has been noted as an important spawning area for trout.</li>    </ul>",

Wallace Houstoun, who first surveyed the area in the 1850s. Twisted fruit trees mark the remnants of the garden and orchard planted by Jeremiah Chivers, a Scotsman who retired here after unsuccessful adventures in the interior gold rushes. Chivers lived alone on the island, never marrying, and died here in 1927 at the age of 92. </p> <p> After the Second World War, David Conover purchased the island and moved here with his wife Jeanne. The couple developed a very successful holiday resort on Wallace Island, and Conover became a successful author, writing four books &ndash; &ldquo;Once Upon An Island&rdquo;, &ldquo;One Man&rsquo;s Island&rdquo;, &ldquo;Sitting On A Saltspring&rdquo; and &ldquo;Finding Marilyn, A Resource&rdquo;. In the first two books he described the  couple&rsquo;s struggles and joys after their purchase of the land in 1946. Their resort, the Royal Cedar Cottages, was advertised as having &ldquo;a modern well-stocked store, cabins, recreation hall and boat rentals.&rdquo; In the mid to late 1960s, Conover sold the majority of the island to a group of teachers from Seattle. Disagreements among the owners led to court proceedings and the property was again put up for sale. Wallace Island was purchased through the court ordered sale and became a provincial marine park in 1990 through the cooperative efforts of the provincial government and BC Marine Parks Forever. </p> </li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The flora of this island is typical of many of the Gulf Islands &ndash; with dry summers, many plants are adapted to germinate and grow in the winter, flower in early spring and become dormant by early summer. The best time for botanical viewing is March through May.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Black-tailed deer are the largest land animals in the park. Sightings of river otters, mink and harbour seals are common. Sea lions can be found in the area in winter, but disappear during the height of the breeding season in July and August. The number of Bald eagles has greatly increased in the area in the last 30 years and are now frequently sighted. Bird watching here is most productive in the spring, winter and fall.</li> </ul>",

A view of Wapiti Falls can be achieved by following a short 200 metre trail off the main trail at kilometre 7. Be sure to bring your camera, as the scenic views are plentiful.",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>      <li><strong>History:</strong> First nations were the earliest people to access this area and have trapped in the Wapiti for many years. In the early 1960s, a local helicopter pilot built the original cabin at the lake. The pilot&rsquo;s cabin eventually succumbed to the ravages of hungry porcupines and time. In the late 1960s, a Catholic Priest prepared a retreat area where spiritual restoration could be obtained. The priest and many others made numerous treks into the solitude of the Wapiti Lake wilderness. In 1983 the BC Forest Service and a Katimivik youth crew upgraded many kilometres of the trail. In 1995 a new cabin was built overlooking the lake. The area was recommended for park status in the Dawson Creek LRMP process and in June 26, 2000 it was established as a Provincial Park.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> First Nations of the Treaty 8 Tribal Association have traditionally used the area.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Significant stands of old growth spruce forests blanket the slopes of the Hart Ranges in this part of the Rocky Mountains. Important habitat for numerous large species such as mountain goat and grizzly bear can be found in the park&rsquo;s diverse topography. The park&rsquo;s tributary streams, rivers and lakes contain numerous fish species. Amongst them, and of particular importance provincially, is the bull trout, a blue listed  species. Internationally significant fossils from the Triassic Period have also been uncovered within the park. Fossilized primitive ichthyosaurs found in the  area have been found nowhere else on earth. Examples of other ichthyosaurs found in the Wapiti area have also been found in far off locals such as China and Japan.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> An abundance of wildlife can be viewed in Wapiti Lake Provincial Park. Moose are common ungulates found in the park&rsquo;s many valley bottoms and marshes. Mountain caribou, although less frequently observed, are also found in the park. In the rocky ledges high above the lake, mountain goat can be observed. Both black bear and grizzly bears wander throughout. Wolves, coyotes, lynx and many small mammals pass through or reside in the park.</li>    </ul>",

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul> <li><strong>History:</strong> Safety Cove was used for anchorage by Charles Duncan in 1788 during a trading expedition that he conducted between the Skeena River mouth and Cape Caution, and was subsequently used by other maritime fur traders. Captain George Vancouver undertook a voyage of the Pacific Ocean from 1791- 1795, where he surveyed a good portion of the coastline of what is now British Columbia. In 1792, Vancouver, deterred by bad weather from continuing the survey, waited securely in Safety Cove. Captain Duncan named Calvert Island, whose name was probably given in honour of the noble house of Baltimore and was retained by Vancouver in 1792.</li> <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Calvert Island is situated within the Heiltsuk and Wuikinuxv First Nation territories. The Heiltsuk people lived in many villages and seasonal camp locations throughout their territory, which includes Calvert Island. The Heiltsuk Nation has collected evidence that dates Namu, a village site close to Calvert Island, at approximately 10,000 years old. First Nation people from the nearby community of Bella Bella currently harvest salmon, halibut, rockfish, clams, crabs, cod, herring, seaweed and countless other marine and terrestrial resources from Calvert Island and its surrounding waters.</li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> This conservancy protects the remainder of Calvert Island and abuts against the Hakai Luxvballis Conservancy Area, which is BC&rsquo;s largest marine park. The diversity of habitats within Calvert Island Conservancy protects a wide variety of wildlife species from limpids and sea urchins to wolves, deer and black bears.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Large runs of Chinook, Coho, Sockeye, Chum and Pink salmon crowd through Hakai Pass from the open Pacific Ocean headed for their natal streams/rivers. There are also halibut, lingcod, red snapper and rockfish in the waters surrounding Calvert Island. Kingfisher, common loon, cormorant and sandpiper occur around Calvert Island and over 100 bird species have been identified in the adjacent Hakai Luxvbalis Conservancy area. The waters surrounding Calvert Island are home to numerous marine mammals such as harbour seals, sea lions, and orcas while Pacific white-sided dolphins frequent Fitz Hugh Sound. The offshore waters are home to minke, gray, and humpback whales as well as porpoises and dolphins. Other mammal inhabitants on Calvert Island include black-tailed deer, wolves, river otters, mink, beavers and black bears. <ul> <li><a href=\"/explore/wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>",

The conservancy provides safe boat anchorages for boaters travelling along the North Coast and good opportunities for recreation activities and wildlife viewing.</li> <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> The Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy lies within the traditional territory of the Gitxaa&#322;a Nation.&nbsp; Members of the Gitxaa&#322;a Nation have lived along the north coast of British Columbia for more than 10,000 years. The territory of the Gitxaa&#322;a Nation extends from <em>Lax Kxeen</em> (Prince Rupert) in the north then south to Princess Royal Island and extends from Hecate Straight in the west then <em>eastward</em> to include the lower reaches of the (Skeena River). Prior to European contact, the Gitxaa&#322;a people lived in villages located throughout the territory. Seasonal campsites were located in strategic locations to facilitate utilization of natural resources. The central home for the Gitxaa&#322;a is now the main village on <em>Lax Klan</em> (Dolphin Island).<br> <br>Gitxaala means &ldquo;people of the salt,&rdquo; which is a reference to the ocean-front location of the Gitxaala community on Dolphin Island. Nii Luutiksm means &ldquo;a special or treasured area.&rdquo; Gitxaala/Kitkatla Inlet provides a wealth of traditional resources that have for millennia sustained the Gitxaa&#322;a. Traditional harvesting of seaweed, roe-on-kelp, cockles and salmon are some of the practices that continue to occur within this inlet. The area&rsquo;s oral history, stone fish-weirs and cache pits within this conservancy represent a history that predates European contact. Protection of cultural uses and values is a dominant feature of this conservancy.<br> <br> The traditional hereditary system of governance is one of the main structures of Gitxaa&#322;a society for cultural, economic and political purposes. The <em>Wil &lsquo;na &lsquo;ta&#322;</em> (House Unit), led by a <em>Sm gyigyet</em> (House Chief) has been the primary unit of each village. Each House in turn is affiliated with one of the four Clans: <em><u>G</u>anhada </em>(raven), <em>Gisbutwada</em> (blackfish), <em>Lax Sgyiik</em> (eagle) and <em>Lax Gyibuu</em> (wolf). There are currently 26 house groups within the Gitxaa&#322;a Nation. Each house has the right to use, and the responsibility to manage, specified land within the larger Gitxaa&#322;a Nation traditional territory. Throughout time the entire territory has been occupied, and resources managed and utilized, according to the laws, traditions and customs of the people. Resources were traded between house groups and with other Tsimshian villages. In recent times the Gitxaa&#322;a Government has incorporated an elected Band Council to work with the Hereditary House Chiefs in governing the Gitxaa&#322;a territory.<br> <br>The Gitxaa&#322;a Nation continues to respect the allocation of resources, management of the land and cultural use of the land at the House level. Each House leader, Chief, is responsible for management of the land holdings of their House to ensure that the land and natural resources are managed in a manner that will provide for future generations.<br> <br> Northern portions of the Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy are of importance and part of the asserted traditional territories of the Coast Tsimshian which includes both the Metlakatla and Lax Kw&rsquo;alaams First Nations. Kwil-Mas (North Porcher Island) is an intensive traditional use area for within the traditional territory of the Gitwylgiots Tribe and of importance for the harvest of roe-on-kelp and other sea resources.<br> <br>Use the below links for information or to contact the Gitxaala First Nation: <ul> <li><a href=\"http://gitxaalanation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Gitxaala Nation</a><br> PO Box 149 <br> Kitkatla, BC, V0V 1C0<br> Phone: 250-848-2214 <br> Fax: 250-848-2238</li> <li><u><a href=\"http://www.metlakatla.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Metlakatla Stewardship Office</a></u><br> P.O.

Gitxaala Inlet is a small inland sea with strong tidal currents ensuring good nutrient exchange. Gitxaala Inlet has a very high habitat rating for waterfowl. Threatened and endangered bird species recorded in these waters include trumpeter swan (overwintering), Brant, long-tailed duck, western grebe, Pacific loon and great blue heron. A large herring spawn occurs in the inlet. A grey whale rubbing beach is also a special feature within this protected area.<br> <br>Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy helps protect the areas biological diversity and natural environments by protecting representative coastal flora and fauna, plant communities and animal species at risk, and special features, particularly lowland coastal muskeg (bogs and fens) and bog forests, limestone features, kelp beds, a highly productive marine ecosystem, the grey whale rubbing beach, a sea lion haul-out, marine invertebrates, and a provincially significant seabird and shorebird feeding and moulting area. Together with nearby Banks Nii Luutiksm and Lax Kul Nii Luutiksm/Bonilla conservancies, Gitxaala Nii Luutiksm/Kitkatla Conservancy protects over 48,000 ha of terrestrial and marine habitats on the outer coast.</li> <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> Black Bears, wolves, waterfowl, eagles, spawning salmon and the occasional deer can be seen in the conservancy.

The southern marine area is dominated by warm shallow, sandy and flat bottom physiography typified by low current and low exposure. The northern marine area is recognized by Fisheries and Oceans Canada as one of the coast&rsquo;s most unique marine ecosystems, characterized by warm shallow, flat-bottomed physiography typified by high current and low exposure. </p> <p> Salmon species that utilize this area include coho, pink and Chinook salmon. Cutthroat trout, Dolly Varden and steelhead trout are also present in most of the small streams entering Kumdis Slough and Kumdis River. Stickleback, crab, shrimp and most shellfish are common, and the area is particularly important to larval forms of invertebrates due to its sheltered location.

A baseline of marine birds were surveyed for the Kumdis slough by Ducks Unlimited in 1991. Other foraging birds recorded along the Kamdis slough are bufflehead, common merganser, and trumpeter swan. </p> <p> Of recent concern is the presence of introduced mammals of which black-tailed deer, beavers and raccoons pose a threat to local ecosystems and species.

Duncan spent from May to August 1788 trading for sea otter skins between Queen Charlotte Island and Princess Royal Island.</li> <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> Kitasoo Spirit Bear is in the asserted territories of the Kitasoo, Heiltsuk and Gitxaala First Nations. In the late 19th century, the Kitasoo and XaiXais people came together to settle in Klemdulxk (Klemtu), meaning &lsquo;blocked passage&rsquo; in the Tsimshian language. Kitasoo Bay is the original home of the Kitasoo people (Tsimshian) with old village sites, burial grounds and very high archaeological and heritage values. There are over 100 documented ancient cultural sites within the Kitasoo/XaiXais traditional territory including abandoned native villages, fish traps, culturally modified trees and middens. Structural remains including charred wooden boards and badly decayed boards were recovered from a prehistoric house at Grant Anchorage.</li> <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> The Kitasoo Spirit Bear Conservancy contributes to a network of protection areas capturing a cross section of biodiversity and provides good representation of the transition between the Hectate Lowlands and Kitimat Ranges Ecosections. The primary role of the conservancy is the protection and conservation of the Kermode bear along with rare and special ecosystems and cultural heritage values. The conservancy provides ecological connectivity with Kitlope and Fiordland through the Khuze and Green watersheds. Special features protected within the conservancy include an example of recent volcanism (Kitasoo Hill), salmonid streams, migration habitat values for waterfowl and possible karst formations.</li> <li><strong>Wildife:</strong> The highest concentration of Kermode bears are found in the Kitasoo Spirit Bear Conservancy consisting of approximately 10% of the black bear population. Laredo Inlet serves as an important feeding site for red listed marbled murrelets and has an abundance of bald eagle nests. Thriving seabird colonies of puffins, murres and cormorants populate the windswept outer islands. Colourful seabirds such as Oystercatchers, Pigeon Guillemots and Rhinoceros Auklets are common as well as large numbers of smaller water birds, such as Phalaropes. The waters around this conservancy are utilized by orcas, humpback whales, Stellar sea lions, sea otters, elephant seals, and porpoises. The area is home to black bears, mountain goats, deer, ravens, foxes and a significant population of grey wolves. Grizzly bears are not common but have been sighted in the area. <ul> <li><a href=\"../../wild_gen.html\">General Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a></li> </ul> </li> </ul>",

Lucy Islands is significant in the protected area system. </p> <p>The conservancy protects: </p> <ul> <li>a globally significant breeding and nesting habitat for seabirds, particularly rhinoceros auklets;</li> <li>an area with important Coast Tsimshian cultural values and documented archaeological sites; and</li> <li>important local recreational opportunities associated, including those related to the interpretation of the rhinoceros auklets, the area&rsquo;s cultural values and associated navigational light.</li> </ul> <a href=\"photos/\"><img class=\"park_photo\" src=\"photos/images/03.jpg\" alt=\"Lucy Islands Conservancy\" title=\"Lucy Islands Conservancy\"></a> <p> A lighthouse is located on the east side of the largest island in the conservancy. Built in 1906, the lighthouse served as a manned station from 1907 to 1988. Other facilities that existed during that time include: </p> <ul> <li>residential buildings for the lighthouse keepers and their families;</li> <li>a boathouse on the southwest side of the main island; and</li> <li>a helicopter pad not far from the boathouse on the western tip of the main island.</li> </ul> <p> A 600-metre long boardwalk, which extended from one end of the island to the other, linked the helicopter pad and the residential buildings. In 1988, the lighthouse was automated and the house was removed.

It is important to respect the privacy of people who travel to the two small lakes on the summit plateau for spiritual activities. <p> Three archaeological sites at the base of the &ldquo;A X&eacute;egi Deiyi&rdquo; trail found just outside of the conservancy boundary highlight the significance of the area. These sites are at the mouth of Pine Creek (a key grayling gathering place) and are important spiritual sites for prayer and cleansing ceremonies. In addition to the trail and archaeological sites, documented Tlingit traditional uses include berry picking, hunting and trapping. </p> </li> <li> <strong>Conservation:</strong> Monarch Mountain/A Xéegi Deiyi Conservancy lies within the Yukon Southern Lakes Ecoregion. This ecoregion is characterized by a gently rolling upland, with wide valleys separating isolated mountains. In the past, this area was largely covered by glaciers that moved northward off the Boundary Ranges to the southwest where they came into contact with glaciers from the Skeena Mountains. </p> <p> The dominant ecosystem in the Monarch Mountain/A Xéegi Deiyi Conservancy is the spruce-willow-birch shrublands. An area of Boreal White and Black Spruce also occurs on the lower slopes on the western side of the conservancy. </p> </li> <li> <strong>Wildlife:</strong> Wildlife diversity in the Monarch Mountain/A Xéegi Deiyi Conservancy is limited by the harsh climate typical of the spruce-willow-birch ecosystem. These high elevation plateaus are not highly used in winter. However, a large variety of wildlife species, including ungulates, large carnivores, small mammals, raptors, song birds, and a host of invertebrate species, use the area in the snow-free months. </p> </li> <li> <a href=\"../../wild_gen.html\">Wildlife, Marine &amp; Outdoor Ethics Information</a> </li> </ul>",

There are four trailheads to the <a href=\"hiking.html#hiking\">Juan de Fuca Trail</a> at        Juan de Fuca East (<a href=\"trailhd.html#china\">China Beach</a>), <a href=\"trailhd.html#sombrio\">Sombrio Beach</a>, <a href=\"trailhd.html#parkinson\">Parkinson Creek</a> and <a href=\"trailhd.html#botanical\">Botanical Beach</a>.        Although most of the Juan de Fuca Marine Trail is designed for        strenuous day or multi-day hiking/camping in this rugged and isolated        area, some easy to moderate day hiking opportunities to the beach        or along the trail are available starting from the trailheads.<br>     <br> At the east end of the park you&rsquo;ll find the vehicle accessible China Beach Campground and the China  Beach day-use area. The campground is located in a forested area with open understory, about 1 km east of the China Beach day-use area and the Juan de Fuca East (China Beach) Trailhead. Trails connect the campground to China Beach and the adjacent smaller Second Beach, located east of the larger China  Beach day-use.<br>     <br> At the west end of Juan de Fuca Park is Botanical  Beach, one          of the richest tidal areas along the west coast. Botanical      Beach also has a unique shoreline framed by ridges of shale and quartz,          which jut up through the black basalt to form huge tableaus.         Botanical Beach is the western terminus for the Juan de Fuca      Marine Trail and a popular day trip destination for visitors wishing to      observe this sensitive and unique ecosystem. Wildlife viewing is best      done at low tide, when visitors can walk out across the flat sandstone         and granite outcroppings to view tide pools filled with brightly      coloured marine life.<br>     <br>When visiting Botanical Beach, please look in the tide pools          only &ndash; do not touch the marine life. Do not remove, collect or disturb any tide pool life, shells, plants, flowers, kelp, etc. Even touching the water in a tide pool with sunscreen on your hands can create an &ldquo;oil slick&rdquo; that could kill the vulnerable creatures in this sensitive ecosystem. Remember to bring your camera, as photographs make great souvenirs.<br>     <br> Juan de Fuca Provincial Park offers ample opportunity to           view larger marine mammals as well, including Grey and killer           whales, which can often be spotted feeding just off the      points. The best time to see Grey whales is during their migration           from the Mexican coast to Alaska in March and April. Seals      and sea lions can also often be seen playing offshore.<br>     <br><strong>Special Features: </strong>This park contains numerous special natural features, including waterfalls, grottos, old growth forest, estuaries, tide pools and shale and quartz rock formations.<br>     <br><strong>Park Size:</strong> 1,528 hectares<br>     <br><table class=\"hours\" cellspacing=\"0\" border=\"1\"><tr><th colspan=\"2\"> Campground Dates of Operation<div class=\"note\">All dates are subject to change without notice</div></th></tr><tr><td width=\"40%\"><strong>Opening and Closing Campground Dates:</strong><br>(campground is accessible but may not offer full services such as water,security, etc.) </td><td width=\"60%\">May 15 &ndash; September 15</td></tr><tr><td>&ndash; China Beach campground </td><td> May 15 – September 15 (campground gate is closed duringthe off-season) </td></tr><tr><td>&ndash; Juan de Fuca trail; wilderness campsites </td><td> All year </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Campground Dates with Full Services and Fees:</strong> </td><td>&nbsp;</td></tr><tr><td>&ndash; China Beach campground </td><td>May 15 &ndash; September 2 </td></tr><tr><td>&ndash; Juan de Fuca trail; wilderness campsites </td><td> All year </td></tr><tr><td><strong>Campground Reservable Dates:</strong> </td><td>China Beach only:<br>May 15 – September 2</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Total Number of Vehicle Accessible Campsites: </strong></td><td>China Beach only: 78</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Number of Reservable Campsites, if applicable:</strong><br>(all remaining sites are first-come, first-served) </td><td>China Beach only: 47</td></tr><tr><td colspan=\"2\"><strong>Note:</strong> The above information isfor the campground only.

			"natureAndCulture": "<ul>   <li><strong>History:</strong> In 1889, Will Roberts, an Englishman, settled at the mouth of Roberts Creek and brought his parents and two sisters out from England. They were joined by a brother and made a living logging, trapping, fishing, hunting and market gardening. They built and operated the first store and Post Office in Roberts Creek. There were, by this time, several families settled in the area. By 1912 tourists from Vancouver came on the Union Steamships which made daily runs all summer. The picnic area was established as a park in 1947 and the campground in 1954.</li>      <li><strong>Cultural Heritage:</strong> This area is the traditional home of the Sechelt Indians. The first recorded visit by a European was in 1791, when Captain Navaez, from the Spanish fort at Nootka sailed the coast. Next came Captain Vancouver in 1792. There was some fur trading along the coast in the following years. In the 1860&rsquo;s, logging became an industry along a narrow strip of the coast.</li>      <li><strong>Conservation:</strong> Douglas-fir, hemlock and cedar forests are found here.</li>      <li><strong>Wildlife:</strong> At low tide the cobblestone ocean beach at the picnic area is a good viewing area for sea stars, mussels and oysters or for watching whales, seals and ducks (in winter) offshore, also home to deer and Douglas squirrels.</li>    </ul>",

The park is south of Highway #16, approximately 90 to 100 kilometres, between Burns Lake and Houston.<br> <br> The Nechako Reservoir (Ootsa and Whitesail Lakes) is the main access route to the northern region of the park but boaters must use caution when travelling on these lakes as the shoreline is a forest of drowned trees and floating debris that create hazardous boating conditions. A number of channels have been cut through the dead trees to give access to emergency landing areas. These provide shelter from the sudden and strong winds that funnel down the lakes from the Coast Mountains. See <strong><a href=\"#GeneralInfo\">Visitor Information</a></strong>. <br> <br> Two common access points to the northern portion of Tweedsmuir Provincial Park are <a href=\"../little_andrews_bay/\">Little Andrews Bay Provincial Park</a> and <a href=\"../wistaria/\">Wistaria Provincial Park</a>.

To protect the special features of the area, unguided access to the volcanic cone is prohibited. The hike is rated as moderate with some hills and steep stairs.</p> <p><strong>Geological History:</strong> As the lava spilled from the crater an estimated 250 years ago, it followed a creek bed downslope to Lava Lake and down the Tseax Valley to the Nass River. The lava travelled at different speeds depending on the steepness of the slope. Some types of lava flow and interesting features include:</p> <ul> <li>Tree cast &ndash; formed by burned out tree trunks leaving holes in the lava.</li> <li>Lava tube &ndash; formed as the top layer cooled and hardened.

The Nis<u>g</u>a&rsquo;a house system is composed of four main families: Wolf, Raven, Killer Whale, and Eagle. Each family owns stories and passes them on to the next generation. </p> <p> One of the most well known stories is about the genesis of the volcano. Legend has it that children had shown disrespect to the life-giving salmon by putting stones and burning sticks into their backs and watching them swim.
