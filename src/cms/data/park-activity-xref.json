Intensive use of confined campsites creates unsanitary conditions for park visitors.</li> <li><h6>Bear/People Conflict Prevention</h6> Bear proof containers must be used for the transportation and storage of all food and garbage.<br> Report all aggressive or unusual bear behaviour and close bear-human interactions (<em>e.g.</em>, a bear in camp, bluff charge, <em>etc.</em>) to the Babine Area Supervisor, 250-847-7565, as soon as possible.</li> <li><h6>Fires</h6> All float trips are requested to use a fire pan. The creation of rock fire rings and the burning of wood on shore is strongly discouraged.<br> All surplus or charred firewood/residual ash should be carried out of the park or deposited in the river. No firewood should be left on shore.</li> <li><h6>Wildlife</h6> <ol style=\"list-style-type: lower-alpha !important;\"> <li> Any viewing of wildlife should be carried out in a discreet manner and from a distance that will not disturb the animal(s) being viewed. </li> <li> Adhere to the <a href=\"http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/wld/twg/\" target=\"_blank\">Wildlife Guidlines</a> when carrying out activities, except where an alternative strategy has been proposed. </li> <li> Limit bear viewing at Grizzly Drop to 30 minutes above the rapid and 10 minutes below the rapid. </li> </ol> </li> </ul> <h5>Safety Information</h5> <ul> <li>Always be on the alert for a potential wrapper rock at the bottom of every drop - it is a good rule for the Babine River in general.

A low tide of 1.2 metres or less is best for viewing these tide pools. Use Canadian Tide Tables &ldquo;Port Renfrew&rdquo; section. Remember to use the PDT (Pacific Daylight Savings Time) for tidal times during March to November as Daylight Savings Time is in effect. Visitors should reference the <a href=\"http://www.waterlevels.gc.ca/eng\" target=\"_blank\">Fisheries and Oceans tide table for Port  Renfrew, Vancouver Island, British Columbia</a>.<br> <br> When visiting Botanical Beach, please look in the tide pools only &ndash; do not touch the marine life. Do not remove, collect or disturb any tide pool life, shells, plants, flowers, kelp, etc. Even touching the water in a tide pool with sunscreen on your hands can create an &ldquo;oil slick&rdquo; that could kill the vulnerable creatures in this sensitive ecosystem.

The first 20 metres of Main Cave, Lower Main Cave, and all of Andres Annex are open for self exploration. </p> <p> Riverbend Cave and Main Cave beyond the gate are only accessible by guided tour. </p> <p> The easiest tour is the Riverbend Cave Explorer Tour (age 5+) that highlights the beautiful crystal formations while navigating the larger passages without having to squeeze or crawl. The shortest tour is not the easiest considering the narrow vertical-squeeze entrance, but the 1 hr Main Cave Adventure (age 5+) features rock scrambling and a ride down Canadaâs only Cave Slide! The Multi-Cave Experience (age 8+) provides 3 hours of cave exploring that combines the best features and challenges for adventurous families and novice cave explorers including a climb up an underground waterfall! Those wanting maximum adventure can sign on to the Extreme Cave &amp; Rappel (age 13+), a five-hour excursion that has explorers rappel down a seven-storey waterfall that leads into the &ldquo;China Shop Passage&rdquo; to reach the very end of this amazing cave with a climb out on a cable ladder. Not for the faint of heart! An outdoor rappel training session is included in the price or available as a stand-alone adventure (age7+). </p> <p> All caving equipment is included on the guided tours with certified cave guides.

Small caves can be found in the limestone outcrops. </p> <p> At the far end of the Stone Corral, beneath the steepest cliffs, lies the large entrance to Corral Cave. Although this cave is only 20 metres deep, it contains a number of fascinating features. The walls are smooth and vertical and the ceiling is high, making for an easy walk-in cave. The floor is rock-strewn, and there are a number of large perpetual drips. In spring and early summer the floor of the cave is a dramatic collection of large icicles. On the left wall, about halfway in, there is a small round hole. This is a typical phreatic tube. The initial dissolution process that widens the cracks underground occurs below the water table. Because of the very slow movement of the water and because it completely fills the crack, the result is a perfectly round tube. Later in the history of a cave when the water-table drops and air enters, if water is still passing through the crack it will selectively erode the bottom portion. The resulting V-shape is known as vadose, as opposed to the round phreatic features. At the end of the cave, if a flashlight is shone up into the top corner, there are a few tiny stalactites. Beyond these is a long descending tongue of a softer white substance, moonsmilk, an organic form of calcite. It is gooey when wet, with a texture like cottage cheese, but crumbly and powdery when dry. The origin of the name is traced to Europe, where the exact translation means &ldquo;gnome&rsquo;s milk&rdquo;. It was used in medieval times as a wound dressing and recent research has shown the appropriateness of this remedy, as moonsmilk contains a number of substances with antibacterial properties. Overhead and along the wall there are also some beautiful calcite flowstone walls, as well as another attractive collection of small stalactites at the drip sites. </p> <p> Another cave can be found along the trail as it leads away from the cliff-edge and crosses a gully. There is a tiny sinkhole with a small opening in the rock-face, this is one of the entrances of Porcupine Cave. Do not enter this opening! Instead, proceed and enter a second sinkhole just over the ridge, as the entrance to the cave from this aspect is larger. Porcupine Cave is 10 metres long, and joins the two sinkholes. It is a classic solutional feature created by the dissolving of limestone by slowly moving water. It is fairly narrow at either end but opens up into a chamber in the middle with standing room. There are fine coral fossils on the ceiling in this chamber. There is also cave popcorn, which is recognized by its knob-like shape, resulting from concentric layering of tiny calcite crystals. The floor of this cave is covered with old porcupine droppings, hence the name. </p> <p> <strong>Caves are fragile environments that need to be treated with the greatest respect. Under no circumstances should you touch the walls, take anything or leave anything.</strong> </p>","isActivityOpen":true,"isActive":true},{"activityNumber":"15","orcs":"425","orcsSiteNumber":"425","description":"There are spelunking or caving opportunities in this park; however, the unique system of caves in this park are considered to be very hazardous.

Fees go towards grooming the trail(s), maintaining emergency shelters, providing insurance and promoting avalanche awareness. Snowmobile day passes can be purchased in Smithers, at Trails North Powersports, Evergreen Industrial Supplies and Wayside Industries, and online from the SSA Website (<a href=\"http://www.smitherssnowmobileassociation.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.smitherssnowmobileassociation.com</a>) and on the trail. </p> <p> BC Parks, in consultation with various user groups, has designated certain areas for snowmobiling.
